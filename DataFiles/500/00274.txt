Courthouse Bomb Scare Closes Schools
May 16, 2011
Final exams for students at our local schools were canceled today. Students were celebrating.But our city officials as well as law enforcement were not. Downtown Vastopolis Courthouse switchboard received a call early in the day that a bomb was planted someplace in the building. The police bomb squad was immediately called. They found nothing.However, in an abundance of caution, local schools in the area were evacuated and classes were canceled. Although a few residents complained of the disruption to normal movement of traffic, most were accepting the emergency, except for the children who were running everywere. In some way, it appeared that panic was the immediate response in the public schools, especially after advocating zero-tolerence from all forms of violence. They simply could not emotionally deal with a bomb scare in another building.  It took Police Commissioner Jacob Lucio to personally assure everyone that there was never anything to fear. The neighborhood is finally back to normal. Final exams for the students will resume tomorrow.
