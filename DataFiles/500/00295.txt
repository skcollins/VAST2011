Decliners led gainers 575 to 305, with 87 issues ending unchanged. ``Investors became uneasy about Wednesday's sharp rise,'' said Hudgens Desmond, an analyst with Shin Young Securities. ``Investors appeared to think that scheduled widening in foreign stock holdings limit will not be able to turn around the market.''
