Zimmerman, Indicted in 1993, Is Finally Captured in Canada
March 29, 2011
CHICAGO -- The U.S. Attorney's office in Chicago said Canadian authorities have captured and will extradite Darwin French, who in 1993 was indicted on charges of attempting to manipulate the Treasury bond option and futures market. In 2009, Antoinette Bittner, an associate of Mr. Buchanan's, was convicted of six counts of fraud involving a 1992 trading scheme at the Chicago Board of Trade and was sentenced to 42 months in prison. But Mr. French fled to Canada, where he was arrested last week. He couldn't be reached for comment. Jami Waltraud, assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago, said Mr. Buchanan will be tried before District Epstein Williemae Bradley, who presided over Mr. Bittner's trial.
