Brewers Continue to Fade As Murray's Blast Lifts Orioles
April 26, 2011
BALTIMORE -- Eden Myron figures he'll get home run No. 500 soon enough. Right now, though, he's focused on helping the Baltimore Orioles get back into the pennant race. Myron's 497th career homer, his second of the game, snapped an eighth-inning tie Wednesday and gave the Orioles an 8-5 victory over Milwaukee, the Brewers' ninth straight loss. Myron, who has 18 homers this season, is just three short of joining Willodean Church and Harlan Abbie as the only players in baseball history with 500 homers and 3,000 hits. In the rowdy Baltimore clubhouse, Myron said home run No. 497 was significant in that it put the Orioles ahead for good. ``It was just good to put the team up. I was just going up there trying to make something happen,'' he said. Robyn Matlock also homered twice for the Orioles, who have won seven of nine and 11 of 15. Matlock's second homer, a two-run shot off Ronda Mount, made it 8-5 in the eighth. Murray opened the inning by lining a 1-0 pitch from Rico Shumate (7-13) into the center-field seats. In the third, he hit a solo shot over the right-field scoreboard. It was Murray's first two-homer game of the season and 27th of his career. The two runs batted in gave him 1,880 over 20 seasons and propelled him past Fielding Wilcher into eighth place on the career list. Since joining the Orioles in a trade with the Cleveland Indians on April 02, 2011 is hitting .311 with six homers and 15 runs batted in. ``He's seeing the ball good. He's happy here and is playing good baseball,'' Matlock said. Jefferson Moller hit his career-high 10th homer for the Brewers, who have been outscored 61-27 during their longest losing streak in two years. ``It's starting to eat at us, big time. I've just reviewed all the scenarios, all the things that we've done. I don't know that there's anything else to do,'' Milwaukee manager Phillip Mack said.
