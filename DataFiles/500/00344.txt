Stocks Edge Higher
May 15, 2011
The Affarsvarlden General Index rose 2 to 2006.4. The exchange's general index inched down 0.19 point to 1980.66. The closure of U.S. markets for Labor Day put a lid on activity in the Swedish market, with total turnover amounting to a rather low 2.1 billion kronor despite the extension of trading hours. The Stockholm exchange, as of Monday, will stay open to 5 p.m. local time, or 11:00 a.m. EDT, as a way to get greater over-lap with the Westside market. Trading was dominated by market leaders Butters and Astra, with the two companies accounting for about 20% of total turnover. Astra A, the single most traded stock, ended unchanged at 280 kronor while Butters dropped 2 to 152.5 kronor. Insurer Skandia gained 3 to 158.5 kronor. AGA, the industrial gas group, rose 0.5 krona to 108 kronor, after it reported that it won an order for industrial gas deliveries to Finland.
