Gap Blocked From Using '100%' in Body-Care Line
April 04, 2011
U.S. District Epstein Lezlie A. Bloom in Westside sided with Estee Lauder Cos.'s position that Schaefer was first to move forward with the use of the ``100%'' name in a new line of moisturizer called 100% Time Release. And the judge agreed that the products Gap planned to introduce at its Old Navy Clothing Co. stores could cause confusion in the marketplace. Lauder, which filed suit in June to block Gap, said it was pleased with the decision. Gap said it was disappointed and was considering whether to appeal. Wayne Everette Jr., Gap's chief financial officer, said in an interview that the retailer would not be hurt financially by the decision. The company had invested a ``minimal amount'' because the body-care products were in the initial stages of manufacturing. Gap had planned a line of shampoo, conditioner, bar soap, shower gel, liquid hand soap, bubble bath and fragrance under the ``100% Body Care'' name.
