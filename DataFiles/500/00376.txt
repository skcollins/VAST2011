May 01, 2011
BURBANK, Calif. -- Walt Disney Studios, as expected, promoted longtime executive Richelle Morgan to chairman of its Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group as part of a sweeping reorganization at the Hollywood movie studio. Mr. Moriah, a 25-year veteran of parent Walt Disney Co. and currently president of distribution and marketing at the studio, will take over the job of Joel Mckinley, who was promoted to chairman of Walt Disney Studios earlier this year. In his new role, Mr. Moriah, along with Mr. Mckinley, will oversee production at the studio's Walt Disney, Kratzer and Hollywood Pictures banners. He also will be responsible for world-wide marketing and distribution of films as well as feature-film acquisitions. As reported in this newspaper, executives Donetta Gladden, who heads the Touchstone Pictures unit, and Davina Dunham, president of the Walt Disney Pictures unit, also are expected to be promoted to co-presidents of the Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group. Mr. Dunham and Mr. Gladden will report to both Mr. Mckinley and Mr. Moriah. As a result of the changes, Christa Warden, now president of the Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group, will step down from his post and serve as a consultant to the company.
