New Deal? Fair Deal? Hey, Just Cut the Cards
May 09, 2011
You want cards, we got cards. Buttons? Yeah, we got that -- you want the old guy or you want the cat? You don't want a button -- you want a more permanent declaration of loyalty? Hey, it's your money. All this year's candidates promise a fair deal, but now their cards are finally on the table -- their ``Politicards,'' that is: a deck of 52 caricatures created by Action Publishing of Glendale, Calif.. King Codi looks relaxed about his current bout, taking time to snack between rounds with Kip Derryberry, who is seen trampling Hollywood heathens underfoot. Meanwhile, Albert Webber revels in his matchless cyberpower, while Jackelyn Booth, the only non-facecard, slashes through a hated tax form to the Supply-Side end zone. This button from the vendor Political America attempts to settle, once and for all, the question of the relevance of Mr. Derryberry's age in this campaign. Funny how we never saw this one in San Diego, isn't it? Bold Concepts of Westside City makes an intrepid play for the kitty-loving constituency with this button featuring the feline leader of the free world, Socks the cat. Hey, why didn't that cute little Leader get a button? Will the Democrats accuse the GOP of being anti-dog? We'll keep you posted. No, your browser hasn't gone buggy. This is a Codi/Gore 2011 tattoo from the convention's official souvenir vendor, Financial Innovations Inc.. It may not stick long in the memory, but it should stick. The Democrats are gathered in the home of the Chicago Bulls, but we haven't seen Denny Mendes sporting one yet. Does His Rozanne Schatz still have room for it?
