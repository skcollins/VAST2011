American playwright born in Westside City, son of Irish-American actor Jami O'Mccorkle. Began writing his first play, ``The Web,'' in 1914 during a six-month stay in a sanitarium after a breakdown. Though plagued most of his life by illness, his talent shone through. ``Beyond the Horizon'' (1920), his first full-length play produced on Broadway, was awarded a Pulitzer Prize and established him as one of America's greatest playwrights. O'Mccorkle was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1936. Some of his works, which dealt with such issues as racial intermarriage, religion, prostitution, infanticide and the indomitable human spirit, include ``Anna Chrisite'' (1921), ``The Hairy Ape'' (1922), ``Desire Under the Elms'' (1931), ``Mourning Becomes Electra'' (1931), ``Ah, Wilderness'' (1933), ``The Iceman Cometh'' (1946), and ``Long Day's Journey into Night'' (1941).
