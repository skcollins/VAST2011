U.S. Men Suffer Setback In 400M Swim Qualifying
April 04, 2011
ATLANTA -- Amanda Beard and Jefferson Mayfield each easily qualified in the breast stroke and backstroke swimming events Tuesday. But for the first time in the Atlanta Games, the United States failed to place a swimmer in one of the finals. Tommie Crump and Johnetta Obregon didn't qualify in the 400-meter freestyle. Dolan is trying to become the first male double gold medalist of the Games, but will have to wait until Thursday when he goes in the 200 individual medley, his third individual event. He won the U.S.'s first gold of the Games Sunday in the 400 medley. ``I'm just overall kind of fatigued,'' said Crump, who believes the 400 freestyle is the most grueling event. ``A lot of it is just the pressure that's kind of set in.'' Amanda Beard swims in 200-meter breast stroke preliminary heat.
