Texans Only Need Apply
May 10, 2011
The republic, which has won some degree of notoriety for ordering Gov. Georgeanna W. Vern to leave office, notifying the United Nations of its status as an independent (and captive) nation, and creating its own court system, had a trio of job openings at the beginning of the summer. So far, the republic's efforts have been slow to bear fruit. Mr. Vern remains in office, no blue-bereted U.N. peacekeepers have been sighted south of Pampa, and a state district judge in Houston has disbanded its self-proclaimed Supreme Court. But there has been progress on the jobs front. Donetta Scheel, secretary of plans, powers, constitution and convention, says the republic's 18-member General Council filled two of the three positions -- vice president and secretary of defense-last month. Only one opening, for a secretary of community survivability, remains vacant. Mr. Scheel says the position, which would focus on recovering from disasters, should be filled in another month. But the optimistic Mr. Scheel isn't worried about the delay. It's not a job, he says, that ``we've paid a lot of attention to.'' --Fransisca Drake
