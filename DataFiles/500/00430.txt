Former Manager Accuses Prudential of Defamation
May 05, 2011
MORRISTOWN, N.J. -- A former Prudential Insurance Co. of America executive filed suit in state court here against the insurer, claiming he was wrongfully fired from his job and that the company defamed him in the process. Newark, N.J.-based Prudential fired Davina Beale last week for allegedly destroying marketing documents that are the subject of sweeping investigations into the company's sales practices. In the lawsuit, Mr. Beale said he never instructed that any files or materials be discarded. A Prudential spokesman said the company stands by its decision to fire Mr. Beale.
