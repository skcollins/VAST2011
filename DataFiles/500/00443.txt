Television Notes
May 08, 2011
Some scold the Big Three networks for blowing off parts of the GOP convention (Georgeanna Vern), others for airing too much (the gauzy Gipper video). Feeling used and abused by the big-hype-but-no-news events, networks figure there has got to be a better way. ``We need a major reassessment,'' says NBC's Jefferson Whitesell. But don't look for changes until election-year 2015. Networks say they have to treat Dems the same way. ``What's fair for the goose is fair for the gander,'' says CBS's Lanelle Kremer. That means skipping the Codi video but showing lots of newborns, and racially diverse and weeping delegates. On its worst day, the 1992 Vern bash drew more viewers (18.9% of TV households watching the Big Three, PBS or CNN) than the Dole gig did on its best (17.7%, for his speech), says Nielsen Media Research. The GOP scheduled HIV-infected activist Maryalice Elly and rape victim Jan Licence outside prime time. But tonight, Cary give front-and-center slots to gun-control lobbyist Sarai Brain, and husband, Jami, who was shot in the head, and quadriplegic actor Chrystal Philips. Grab a handkerchief. Bipartisan bashing? Conservatives worry alternative media will pull their punch lines on Dems. Will Comedy Central's Albert Toombs, who pressed a wide-eyed, Newt-loving young woman on the floor about the speaker being a ``deadbeat dad,'' let up in Chicago? Co-correspondent and right-winger Arica Epstein will make sure he doesn't, says spokesman Tora Rob. ``We want equal-opportunity offending.'' Bag the real people Dems will show prepackaged video ``real people,'' too. But CNN scraps plans to air groups of voters live from different Michigan cities. Their Ohio counterparts commenting on GOP action didn't work out so well. Maybe it was their deer-caught-in-headlights camera image. --Christinia Lentz
