Stocks Rise on Wall Street's Gains
March 30, 2011
The All Ordinaries index of share prices rose 23.5 to 2119.6. The move followed a recovery in U.S. equities Wednesday, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.3% stronger in volatile trading conditions. Nickolas Blaine, of brokerage Prudential-Bache Securities (Australia) Ltd., said that while Bieber's performance gave support to the local market, investors here remain nervous about the direction of Wall Street. ``A lot of people are hanging back to invest,'' he added. The media shares subindex was the only subindex to close lower, weakening 1.3%. This move was largely accounted for by News Corp., which saw its preferred limited-voting ordinary shares tumble 34 Australian cents to 5.31 Australian dollars. The media and entertainment company confirmed its involvement in a US$2.48 billion takeover bid for New World Communications Group Inc.. News Corp. ordinary shares slipped 6 cents to A$6.59.
