Military Weapons Discovered at Airport
May 20, 2011
The Transportation Safety Administration seized a large container with 20 military grade rifles today at Vastopolis airport. TSA official Jerry Loudermilk was not able to disclose the destination of the contraband other than the fact it was found in the cargo hold of an international carrier. The owner of the container has not been identified. Vastopolis airport official Treasa Fields told VastPress that finding this type of contraband is a rare occurence. ``We sometimes find drugs and other banned substances, but never a shipment like this.'' Fields states. Airport security was put on alert and travelers should allow for extra time to pass through checkpoints.
