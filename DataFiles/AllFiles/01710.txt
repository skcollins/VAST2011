Americas Stocks End Mixed; Mexico Falls on Profit-Taking
May 10, 2011
Mexican stocks fell as investors took profits from recent rallies. Canadian share prices advanced, but the session was noted more for its lack of activity than anything else. In Argentina, stocks declined as investors frowned on changes legislators introduced into a fiscal bill. Brazilian shares rose in strong trading boosted by the government's quick response to reduce state value-added tax on export products. In dollar terms, the Americas sector of the Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 0.22 to 155.92 Wednesday, after rising 0.62 the previous day. The world index as whole lost 0.38 to 139.42 Wednesday, following Tuesday's gain of 0.28. Computer and air freight shares led the Dow Jones Global Industry Groups, while fishing and overseas-trading issues were among the laggers.
