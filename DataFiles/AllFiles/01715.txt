Dillon Mose Resigns In Wake of Scandal
May 12, 2011
Vastopolis -- Political adviser Dillon Mose abruptly resigned from the Codi campaign following allegations about indiscretions in his personal life reported by a supermarket tabloid. The timing of his exit disrupted what had been a smooth convention week for President Codi. In his resignation letter, Mr. Mose said he wouldn't subject his family and friends ``to the sadistic vitriol of yellow journalism.'' The tabloid's allegations were printed Thursday in the New York Post. Mr. Mose didn't directly address the charges, saying, ``I will not dignify such journalism with a reply or an answer.'' Mr. Codi accepted the resignation, saying Mr. Mose was his friend and a ``superb'' political strategist. ``I am and always will be grateful for the great contributions he has made to my campaigns, and for the invaluable work he has done for me over the years,'' the president said in a statement.
