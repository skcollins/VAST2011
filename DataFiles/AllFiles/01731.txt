Stocks Drop Slightly
May 09, 2011
The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 0.85 to 1094.59. About 26.3 million shares valued at 1.57 billion baht changed hands. Declining stocks outnumbered advancers 181 to 97, excluding foreign shares. The SET 50 index, which reflects the performance of the largest-capitalized stocks, fell 0.10 to 83.56. Dealers attributed the thin trading Tuesday to political anxieties among investors, and to holidays in London and Hong Kong Monday. Dealers said investors also reacted negatively to the Thai parliament's decision to delay the consideration of a non-confidence motion against Prime Minister Bevis Silpa-Sadler until May 31, 2011 just means we're going to be treading water until the no-confidence debate, which is a long, long way off,'' said Markita Baldwin, a dealer with Asset Plus Securities Co. in Bangkok. Among the most actively traded stocks Tuesday, Siam Commercial Bank racked up the biggest gains -- but only on its foreign shares. Those shares rose 8 baht to 326 baht. Its local shares, however, remained unchanged at 256 baht.
