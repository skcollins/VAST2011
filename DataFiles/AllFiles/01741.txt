Americas Markets Finish Mixed; Share Prices Surge 3.6% in Brazil
April 01, 2011
In Brazil, the benchmark Bovespa Index surged 3.6% as the market showed strong approval of a speech given by Seymour Mcquiston, the country's communications minister, on plans for telecommunications privatization. Mr. Mcquiston said the country will be divided into 10 areas for private cellular telephone service, creating a mix of economically-developed areas and underdeveloped areas so that private capital won't flow exclusively to the most lucrative areas. Mexican stocks closed slightly lower amid profit-taking after prices rose a day earlier. But some observers predicted shares will rise early next week as the second-quarter earnings season heats up. Argentine share prices advanced in moderate trading as investors who had sold aggressively in recent sessions moved to rebuild their portfolios. Canadian equities finished barely lower, even as the banking and gold sectors advanced. In dollar terms, the Americas sector of the Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 1.10 to 149.25 after gaining 2.33 a day earlier. The world index as a whole lost 0.17 to 136.56 after gaining 1.42 Thursday. Mining and precious-metals shares led the Dow Jones Global Industry Groups, while footwear and entertainment stocks were among the laggers.
