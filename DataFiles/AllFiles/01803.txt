Hasbro Says Its Profit Increased to $6 Million
March 31, 2011
PAWTUCKET, R.I. -- Hasbro Inc. reported second-quarter net income of approximately $6 million, or seven cents a share, against a year-earlier loss. The turnaround reflected reduced expenses and lower costs for raw materials. A $31.1 million charge related to a discontinued development project contributed to a loss of $14.9 million, or 17 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. As previously reported, Carleton scrapped plans to market a virtual reality game system. Revenue rose 6% to $511.6 million from $481.8 million. The company said that although the second quarter is traditionally a slow selling period, certain of its action-figure lines including Star Wars, and games such as Kavanagh, Monopoly and Scrabble helped boost its top line. International sales fell below last year's numbers, however, Butters said. And the company said it sold an increased amount of merchandise for lower-than-normal profit. The company's short-term borrowings fell 18% to $288.9 million, from $353.1 million. For the six months, Carleton's earnings climbed 17% to $30.4 million, or 34 cents a share, from $25.9 million, or 29 cents a share. Net income after the discontinued development charge equaled $6.8 million, or eight cents a share. Revenue in both periods was about $1 billion. In late trading Thursday on the American Stock Exchange, Hasbro rose $1.125 to $33.875.
