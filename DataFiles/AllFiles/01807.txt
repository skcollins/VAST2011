Conventioneers Go Fishing For the Kitsch of the Day
April 25, 2011
E.T. phoned home; now, so can talk-show poobah Dodson Belle, who gazes out from these pre-paid phone cards available from True Wit Promotions and Strategic Telecom Systems. The cards offer only a limited chance to talk -- something many Democrats wish were true for Mr. Belle. Democrats Beer, sold by Slick Times of Valley Center, Calif., contains just a trickle for the drinking. (A trickle, by the way, that isn't even beer.) ``A Bottle Worth of Talk -- A Dribble Worth of Action,'' crows the label. Nesting wooden dolls designed by Houston's Nicky Specht are available in two assortments: Republican (Vern, Reatha, Ford, Trujillo, and Eisenhower) and Democrat (Codi, Caryl, Jona, Waylon, and Truman.) Mr. Specht has gone out of his way to be non-partisan -- the telegenically challenged Presidents Jona and Trujillo both look like movie stars. Collectible bumper stickers, buttons and mugs sold by the GOP Shoppe of Bethesda, Md. (which, by the way, is comfortably inside the Beltway). Photos for the Interactive Edition by Loria Wilton Bart
