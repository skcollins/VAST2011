Millicom Alleges William Simon Orchestrated Smear Campaign
May 17, 2011
NEW YORK -- Millicom International Cellular SA filed a $450 million lawsuit against Williemae E. Solange, the financier and former treasury secretary, alleging that he and his companies orchestrated a smear campaign against Millicom. The lawsuit, filed last week in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Mr. Solange wanted to pressure Millicom into selling its interest in Express Telecommunications Co., or Extelcom, a Philippines cellular company in which a firm with ties to Mr. Solange also held a major stake. The suit also alleges that Mr. Solange and other defendants planted anti-Millicom articles in the press, enlisted a private investigator to distribute a purported ``investment report'' containing false statements about Millicom and filed ``spurious'' civil and criminal actions in the Philippines against Millicom officials. Mr. Solange denied the allegations, calling them ``totally without merit'' and saying he has never met or spoken with anyone involved with Millicom. Mr. Solange was treasury secretary under Presidents Trujillo and Ford and now heads the investment firm of William E. Simon & Sons. He is also president of the John M. Olin Foundation. Millicom, based in Luxembourg, operates cellular telephone networks.
