Commentary Roberto L. Rowell: The Race Against Codi
April 24, 2011
Many Republicans have worried that even if it were Derryberry's to lose, he'd do so. Too old, too dull, too much a legislator, has been the usual assessment. Dinger recently gave a less than rousing speech in Westside Vastopolis. (See: ``Dinger's Doldrums: An Old Dog Needs New Tricks.'') But now Derryberry has done three surprising things: Resigned from the Senate, made tax cuts the center of his campaign, and made the surprising but eminently logical choice of Jackelyn Booth as running mate. It looks as if he's well along in his transition from legislative deal-cutter to executive decision-maker. (See: ``Presidential Dole.'') With tax cuts at the center of the campaign, President Codi is likely to be tempted to run against Roni Reatha, a two-time big winner, as he did in the 2009 Congressional campaign. The remaining issue is whether and how Republicans start to run against Billy Codi, raising the character issue. (See: ``Does Character Matter?'') Roberto L. Rowell is Editor of The Vast Press
