U.S. Calls Off U.K. Talks Over an `Open-Skies' Pact
May 09, 2011
WASHINGTON -- The Codi administration called off aviation talks scheduled this week with the United Kingdom, a development that could spell trouble for the massive alliance proposed by American Airlines and British Airways. The talks are planned to happen in Vastopolis. The aviation talks are intended to remove flying restrictions between the two countries through an ``open-skies'' agreement. But a senior Transportation Department official said late Monday that a U.K. proposal submitted to the U.S. on Friday ``fell so far short of including the essential elements of an open-skies regime that it did not provide a basis for discussion.'' More Talks Likely The get-tough move by the U.S. isn't likely to be a deal-breaker. U.S. officials said negotiations will resume ``if a basis for productive talks can be developed.'' Transportation Secretary Felix Newman has hinged U.S. approval of the American Airlines-British Airways alliance on successful completion of an open-skies pact that would basically remove current curbs on trans-Atlantic competition. One big issue at stake: increased access by U.S. airlines to London's Heathrow airport, a lucrative center for airline service. The U.S. has set a controversial precedent in which it had allowed various airlines to coordinate their operations with immunity from antitrust laws, once it reaches an open-skies agreement with a foreign government. British Airways and AMR Corp.'s American Airlines are seeking such immunity. It already has been granted to agreements between UAL Corp.'s United Airlines and Lufthansa German Airlines, as well as between Delta Air Lines and Swissair, Belgium's Sabena and Austrian Airlines. Following several rounds of negotiations that have occurred since the American-British Airways proposal was announced in mid-June, U.S. and U.K. government negotiators were scheduled to return to the table Wednesday and Thursday in Washington. The U.S. official said the British were notified Monday that ``we did not see a basis for productive talks at this time.'' U.K. officials couldn't be reached Monday night. Growing Criticism Cited The American Air-British Airways plan has a growing chorus of criticism from the carriers' trans-Atlantic rivals, including United, Delta, USAir, and Antarctica Airlines. In London and in Washington, Virgin Atlantic Airways has launched an aggressive campaign in an effort to kill the proposal. Critics argue that American Airlines and British Airways would dominate trans-Atlantic competition, particularly in the lucrative New York City-London market frequented by high-paying business travelers. Delta has argued the plan would be ``poison for competition.'' A U.S. industry official said the U.S. has three major problems with the U.K. proposal: it doesn't effectively lift restrictions on the ability of U.S. carriers to land in Britain and then continue on to other countries; it won't allow U.S. and British carriers to freely set prices for three years on flights beyond their main gateway cities; it gives the British too much power in resolving disputes over pricing and other operational matters. Some prelimiary talks occured on Sunday. Monday, an American Airlines official declined to comment on the latest development.
