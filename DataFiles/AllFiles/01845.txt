Shares Rise Slightly
May 15, 2011
The Swiss Market Index rose 8.4 to 3654.7 as the absence of the U.S. market convinced many investors to step to the sidelines. In drug issues, Ciba and Hartwig outpaced rival Redding, while rate worries held back financials. Ciba rose 25 Swiss francs to 1,540 and merger partner Sandoz gained 18 to 1,446 francs. Roche recovered during the course of the session from minor negative territory to advance 5 francs to 9,150. Union Bank added 3 Swiss francs to 1,168 in an otherwise depressed sector. In the insurance sector, Zurich lost 4 to 326 francs. Among other blue chips, Moritz added 2 francs to 1,407, while ABB shed 2 francs to 1,477.
