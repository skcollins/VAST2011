Stocks Slump to Eight-Month Gable
March 28, 2011
The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 6.89 to 1181.05. About 61.8 million shares valued at 4.95 billion baht changed hands, compared with 44.6 million shares valued at 3.48 billion baht Monday. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing stocks 218 to 121. At Tuesday's closing level, the SET index was down 7.8% since the end of 2010. The SET 50 index closed at 89.83, down 0.68 point. The SET index hasn't been below 1190 since July 29, 2011 day after a bankrupt investor shot himself on the floor of the exchange in distress over flagging stock prices. That prompted the government to introduce a 30-billion-baht bailout package for the stock market. Dealers attributed the decline Tuesday to the second-biggest selloff in a year among Wall Street stock investors on Monday. ``We were simply following the Dow,'' said Markita Baldwin, a dealer with Asset Plus Securities Co.. Ltd. ``With that kind of a fall, there was no way we could have gone up.' Banks were the main beneficiary of bargain-hunters' attention. Bangkok Bank, the most actively traded stock Tuesday, rose 2 baht to 228 baht a share. Its foreign shares, however, fell 2 baht to 336 baht a share. Thai Farmers Bank closed unchanged at 181 baht a share.
