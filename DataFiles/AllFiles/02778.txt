Americas Shares End Higher; U.S. Rate Fears Hurt Mexico
May 16, 2011
Mexican stock prices fell amid investors' concerns about recent political events and the possibility of rising U.S. interest rates. The Canadian stock market's key index rebounded after a significant decline earlier in the day, on weaker-than-anticipated U.S. economic news and strong gains in the Toronto market's energy and conglomerate sectors. In Argentina, share prices posted gains on optimism generated by higher tax collections and government promises to loosen up the country's rigid labor system. Brazilian stocks rose, responding to lower U.S. 30-year treasury bond yields and the recovery staged by the New York Stock Exchange. In dollar terms, the Americas sector of the Dow Jones World Stock Index rose 0.45 to 153.48 Tuesday, after remaining flat Monday. The world index as whole advanced 0.01 to 136.88 Tuesday, after slipping 0.16 a day earlier. Oil-drilling and medical-device shares led the Dow Jones Global Industry Groups, while airline and lodging issues were among the laggers.
