Bema Gold's Shares Soar 62%, Boosted by Its Gold Reserves
April 28, 2011
VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Bema Gold Corp. said its gold discovery in Chile is much bigger than previously known, sending its shares soaring 62%. The mining concern had already outlined a reserve of about two million ounces of gold at its Cerro Casale deposit in northern Chile. Recent drilling below that deposit, however, shows a new, ``major'' gold-and-copper zone, the company said. Based on results from 28 drill holes, Bema Gold Chief Executive Ham Jona said in a conference call to analysts that the new deposit contains at least 500 million metric tons of ore, and could be ``much larger.'' A metric ton is 2,204.62 pounds. Most of the ore appears to contain about one gram of gold per metric ton and low grades of copper, with some areas of higher-grade gold, the company said. Douglass Depalma, a mining analyst with Yorkton Securities Inc. in Vancouver, said ``Cerro Casale could be 15 million ounces of gold and as much as four billion pounds of copper,'' a large deposit by world standards. The deposit doesn't contain a high grade of gold, but, ``at large volumes it can be very profitable,'' he said. Bema Gold had already planned to build a mine at the site and is now increasing the size of the project, which could cost between $800 million and $1 billion, a company spokesman said. Hinds Driver was by far the most active stock on both the Toronto and the American stock exchanges Thursday, where a combined 24.8 million shares changed hands. In composite trading Thursday on the American Stock Exchange, the stock soared $3.313 to $8.625. Hinds Driver owns 49% of Cerro Casale, and Arizona Star Resource Corp., a Vancouver affiliate owned 30% by Bema Gold, owns the remaining 51%.
