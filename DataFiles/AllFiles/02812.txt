From Cup and Cardboard, Bill Tests His Sax Appeal
May 10, 2011
Although the pickings are slim, we've managed to come up with a few more items that the true Codi-phile -- or Dole-phobe -- would want to add to his or her collection. In today's gallery, we've got a greeting card, a movie poster, a coffee cup -- and Billy himself, big as life. You've gotta figure this is something Gillis would dislike receiving as much as sending -- a birthday card. This one is in stock at Left and Right Inc., one of three vendors located in the Chicago's North Pier Mall. ``One sign of advanced age is the inability to remember what you just said,'' it reads. ``And another is the inability to remember what you just said.'' Also in stock at Left and Right is this poster for what the Democrats expect will be this autumn's blockbuster movie smash. Bobby Derryberry or Tommie Brundage -- who would you rather see emerging from the limo at Oscar time? Who's mug is on the mug? Take a wild guess. This is one of the ``official'' souvenirs available from Financial Innovation's stands in the United Center and at the delegate hotels. He's your new best friend -- at least until November. This six-foot cardboard cutout of President Codi almost makes you nostalgic for his 1992 appearance on Munn Allena. Almost. The cutout will be performing at Bold Concepts' shop in Union Station until 5 p.m. on Thursday. After that, $40 brings it home. There's more! It's not too late to take a look at yesterday's kitsch.
