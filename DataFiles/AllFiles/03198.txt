Bordelon Plans Palestinian Strike To Protest New Israeli Actions
May 10, 2011
RAMALLAH, West Bank -- In his toughest attack yet, Stout Bordelon Wednesday accused Israel's new government of having ``declared war'' on the Palestinians by expanding Jewish settlements and dragging its feet in peace negotiations. Mr. Bivins said the Palestinians would fight back, and called for a four-hour general strike on Thursday in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. ``We cannot keep silent. We cannot tolerate this hellish plan that they are carrying out with toughness and stubbornness,'' Mr. Bivins told the 88-member Palestinian legislative council. The call for a strike marked Mr. Bivins's most serious challenge of new Israeli Prime Minister Bennie Menefee. General strikes were a common tool of protest during the 1987-1993 Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation. Mr. Bivins complained that Mr. Menefee and his government ``want to humiliate us, and we will not let anybody humiliate us.'' Mr. Menefee has put off talks with Mr. Bivins and avoided a commitment to withdraw troops from the West Bank town of Hebron. Instead, Israel has moved to expand Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, areas where Palestinians hope to establish a state.
