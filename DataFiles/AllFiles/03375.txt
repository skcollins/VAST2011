Unsportsmanlike Conduct
May 2, 2011
Has anyone seen the mascot? That is the question one team was asking after their mascot was missing after a basketball game at the Vastopolis Dome. Workers at the Dome had reported that the opposing team's mascot went missing after the game. Workers and the team searched all around the dome's interior and could not find any hint as to where the mascot was. Police later informed the team that the mascot had been found tied up near the steps of the capital building. Team owner Christopher Damron said this was a very cruel joke. When asked about the mascot's identity, Damron said the mascot would rather go unnamed and did not want to be identified. When asked how an animal could make such a request, Damron would not comment. Damron is left hoping that justice can be found and that the criminals will be exposed by the pending police investigation.
