Codiites Should Steer Clear Of the Convention Emporium
April 26, 2011
There's no end of anti-Codi kitsch for sale at the GOP convention's emporium. Indeed, it's best for Democrats to stay out of this room, and avoid the kitsch-blitz against Codi. Among the choice offerings is a chance to dress -- and undress -- the president any way you choose, on your own refrigerator. This change purse, sporting red, white and blue elephants, comes with a lock and keys. Suzi Mcbride, the maker of the purse, included the lock ``to keep Billy Codi out'' -- or so the vendor said. A computer-altered photo of Billy Codi depicts him as beefy and patriotic, in an American-flag jacket that probably wouldn't zip up over his chest. No word on when the president is joining the cast of Baywatch. Hiroko Codi or Dakota Odonnell? Another button portrays Hiroko as Misti Gorton, perhaps heading to the White House with that basket of corn. Haven't had your fill of kitsch? More items are available for your viewing pleasure.
