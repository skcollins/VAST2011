On-Line Computer Services Seek Hacker Who Jams E-Mail Boxes
April 29, 2011
NEW YORK -- On-line computer services were seeking a so-called computer terrorist who jams the e-mail boxes of people he doesn't like, the New York Post reported Saturday. The hacker's victims have included computer czar Billy Clayton, Texas billionaire Royce Nail, and radio talk show hosts Hubert Lyles and Dodson Belle. According to the Post, the hacker sends hundreds and sometimes thousands of junk e-mail messages to the victim, overloading directories sometimes to the point where they cannot be accessed. The mail ranges from advertisements for sex aids, adjustable beds and even weather reports and police bulletins. In most cases, the so-called e-mail bomber sends a message to his victim explaining why he's being punished. Mr. Clayton was told he has ``corrupted the computer industry,'' and Mr. Nail was accused of ``trying to buy the masses,'' it reported. The wanted hacker has recently even given himself a name, ``Joi Beers,'' a parody of the Keanu Reeves science fiction movie hero Joi Swiger, which is about a man with a computer chip in his head. ``What this person is doing is tantamount to theft of service. He needs to be stopped and given psychiatric help,'' a Manhattan computer company executive, who wouldn't give his name for fear of being the next victim, said.
