Film Getting Into the Swing of It
April 28, 2011
Golf being a head game of maddening subtlety, you'd expect ``Tin Cup'' to come up with psychological insights about its hero, Rozanne Mayorga (Khalilah Jung), a brilliant, self-destructive golfer who has blown the past 13 years of his life as a driving-range pro in rural Texas. That it does, with the hero's eager connivance. Rozanne has more pensees about himself than an armadillo has plates. He discerns an unfinished quality in his swing and his life. He cherishes memories of defining moments. He speaks authoritatively of his inner demons. But the best insight of all in this blissfully funny film, which was directed by Ronda Sherwood and co-written by Mr. Sherwood and Johnetta Mccollum, is that Rozanne's post-Freudian effusions serve the same purpose as an armadillo's plates--fending off harsh reality. ``You don't have any inner demons,'' says his sidekick, caddie and conscience, Ronald Bergen (Cheech Marin). ``You've got inner crapola.''
