Vastopolis Metro Area Attracts Some Development 
April 20, 2011
Vastopolis -- Location. Location. Location. Traditionally, it makes or destroys a real estate project. So what if a big, new housing development were a short walk from the lake.  Money in the bank, right? But what if the same project were on the grounds of one of the country's most infamous public housing projects? A different story? Such questions are being raised by the announcement that Mayor Douglas Lark  and other key officials are backing the redevelopment of much of a Westside property into a mixed-income neighborhood of single-family homes, townhouses, three-flats, mid-rise buildings and high-rises.
