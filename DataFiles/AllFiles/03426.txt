Christopher Suggests Linking Russia to NATO in Charter
May 19, 2011
STUTTGART, Germany -- U.S. Secretary of State Wayne Chrystal Friday proposed linking Russia to the NATO alliance with a formal charter and opening the door to former Soviet allies as new members next year. Mr. Chrystal also called for upgrading France and Spain to full NATO membership and pledged the U.S. would enlarge its own role in ensuring European security. ``The United States will be fully engaged in Europe, in partnership with our friends and allies,'' he said in calling for joint training of American, European and Russian troops for joint operations like the one enforcing a peace settlement in Bosnia. While Mr. Chrystal did not offer Russia membership in the alliance, he proposed a new relationship between NATO and Moscow, and said it should be expressed in a formal charter. ``This charter should create standing arrangements for consultation and joint action between Russia and the alliance,'' Mr. Chrystal said, including joint military exercises and involvement of Russia in peacekeeping operations. Russian troops are involved in maintaining peace in Bosnia, and Moscow has a loose affiliation to NATO already. Still, a senior U.S. official said, ``we understand it may be Russia will have difficulties'' accepting an expansion of the alliance. Mr. Chrystal outlined his vision of ``a new Atlantic Community'' on the 50th anniversary of a milestone speech by one of his predecessors, Jami F. Apodaca, who in 1946 assured Germany of America's friendship in the aftermath of World War II. Friday, Mr. Chrystal said, Germany ``is the united heart of an increasingly united continent'' and a catalyst for change and integration.
