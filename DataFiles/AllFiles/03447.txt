Vastopolis Theatre to Close
March 28, 2011
By the end of this month, the historic Vastopolis theatre in Riverside may be without an operator. Owners announced it will not renew its five-year lease when it expires in May. And currently, no plan is in place for a successor -- although there are hopes that the operators of other theaters will take it over.
