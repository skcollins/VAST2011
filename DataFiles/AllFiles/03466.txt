Wall Street's Slide Sinks Market
May 12, 2011
Stocks, already lower at midday, fell further during afternoon trading as the Dow Jones Industrials tumbled after opening. The 25-share AEX index lost 7.96 points to 550.99, after falling 4.43 points on Thursday. The Midcap index gave up 15.14 points to 839.05. Even the firm dollar couldn't help the Amsterdam index. The dollar stood at 1.6573 guilders, up from late Thursday's 1.6560 guilders. The Dutch stock market is highly dollar sensitive as a number of index companies derive much of their overseas revenues in dollars.
