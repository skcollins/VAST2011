April 01, 2011
The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 2.66 to 840.05 on volume of 15.2 million shares. Gainers led decliners 407 to 364, with 152 stocks unchanged. ``Blue chips, which have a big impact in the index's movement, gained ground in the day encouraged by expectations that the world semiconductor prices have reached a bottom,'' said Mabelle Cheong-Valdez, an analyst at Daewoo Securities. Samsung Electronics gained 2,500 won to 76,700; and Hyundai Motor climbed 500 won to 30,500. Seondo Electric was up 2,500 won to 70,000; and Chang Won Carburetor rose 2,300 won to 42,000. Hanbo Steel advanced 370 won to 6,660 after it obtained the largest stake in a Russian gas project. Ssangyong Motor was up 330 won to 5,940 on rumors that it may sell a local plant site to Samsung Group. Financial issues were mixed. Shinhan Bank gained 400 won to 14,900; Hyundai Securities was up 100 won to 18,600; Sam Sam Merchant Bank shed 400 won to 12,900; and LG Insurance fell 1,100 won to 85,900. In addition, mining companies declined because of profit-taking over recent gains, analysts said. Dongwon lost 3,100 won to 56,000; and Young Poong Mining & Construction dropped 800 won to 37,500.
