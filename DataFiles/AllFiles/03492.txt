Chase Completes a Stage Of Merger With Chemical
May 17, 2011
NEW YORK -- Chase Manhattan Corp. said it completed the most visible stage in its merger with the former Chemical Banking Corp., after a busy holiday weekend that saw signs, forms and brochures bearing the Chemical name replaced by those advertising Chester, the name of the surviving company. The nation's largest bank also launched its integrated deposit product line, which includes a new ``Self Service Banking'' account that has lower balance requirements for customers who bank by phone and computer. And it introduced a new advertising campaign, with the slogan: ``The right relationship is everything.'' But although the changes completed this weekend mark the most obvious consequences of the nation's second-largest bank merger -- at least as far as customers are concerned -- a Chase spokesman said much work remains to be done before the merger is truly complete. ``It's the last of the visible changes,'' said Kendra Tharpe, a vice president in the corporate communications department. Mr. Tharpe said another stage will be completed next month, when the Chase credit-card portfolio is fully combined with the Chemical portfolio.
