European Stocks Close Flat Ahead of Thursday's Holiday
April 26, 2011
Meanwhile, a combination of better-than-expected U.K. employment data, a stronger dollar and early gains on Wall Street helped U.K. shares finish higher, but German share prices slipped despite gains in the automobile sector. Falling bond yields as well as gains for pharmaceutical concern Astra buoyed Swedish stocks, and share prices in Zurich rose on a stronger dollar. However, Spanish stocks edged lower on Tuesday's drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and South African gold shares fell on a declining gold price. The Europe/South Africa sector of the Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 0.34 to 144.23 Wednesday, following Tuesday's gain of 0.52. The world index as a whole lost 0.02 to 138.33, adding to Monday's loss of 0.17. Pipeline and communications stocks led the Dow Jones Global Industry Groups, while precious-metal and water-utility issues were among the weakest. European Stock Market Indexes Market Belgium
