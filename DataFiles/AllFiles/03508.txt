Disney's Distribution Chief To Head Movie Department
April 29, 2011
Vastopolis -- Richelle Morgan, chief of film distribution for the Walt Disney Co., will become chairman of the studio's motion-picture group in an ongoing reorganization, Disney announced Saturday. Mr. Morgan takes over the duties of Joeann Maynard, who was promoted in April to chairman of Disney Studios, with responsibility for world-wide video and television operations as well as movies. With losses mounting into the millions, the studio in June announced it was cutting its live-action movie slate by up to half. From a current total of about 36 movies this year, Disney plans to release no more than two dozen in 2012. Mr. Morgan began his 25-year Disney career as a ride operator at Disneyland. He worked in pay television, helped plan the Disney Channel and moved into movie distribution in 1988. He also helped plan the world's largest premiere for the animated movie ``Pocahontas'' in New York's Central Park last year, and the premiere of ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' at the Superdome in New Orleans this year.
