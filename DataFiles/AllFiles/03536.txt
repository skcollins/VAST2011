May 02, 2011
The market's key IPC index rose 77.12 to 3401.79, after losing 36.71 Monday. The previous record high was 3361.39, set last Friday. Volume totaled 1.5 billion pesos on 160 million shares traded. Traders said the market got a boost from second-quarter growth figures released late Sunday that showed the economy expanded 7.2% in the second quarter from the year-ago period, surpassing government estimates of 5%. At midday Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve said it wouldn't alter short-term rates, which also bolstered trade, according to dealers. Among winning issues Tuesday were nominal shares of builder Tribasa, which rose 2.02 pesos, or 14%, to 16.50 pesos, and ``B'' shares of soft drink bottler Emvasa, which gained 52 centavos, or 10.4%, to 5.52 pesos. Bellwether Telmex ``L'' shares climbed 46 centavos, or 3.9%, to 12.42 pesos. Telmex American depositary receipts rose 1 1/4, or 3.9%, to $33 3/8.
