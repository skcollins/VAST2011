How the Poll Was Conducted
May 05, 2011
The sample was drawn from 210 randomly selected geographic points in the continental U.S. Each region was represented in proportion to its population.  One of these locations happened to be Vastopolis. Households were selected by a method that gave all telephone numbers, listed and unlisted, an equal chance of being included. One adult, 18 years or older, was selected from each household by a procedure to provide the correct number of male and female respondents. Chances are 19 in 20 that if all adults with telephones in the U.S. had been surveyed, the finding would differ from these poll results by no more than 3.5 percentage points in either direction among all registered voters. Sample tolerances for subgroups are larger.
