Fujitsu Acquires U.S. Patents For Color-TV Plasma Displays
April 26, 2011
Fujitsu Ltd., one of Japan's biggest computer makers, said it acquired basic patent rights in the U.S. for its plasma-display technology and aims to license it to other companies. The company acquired U.S. patents for the use of plasma-displays in color television sets late last month and expects to obtain patents for the manufacturing process by the end of this year, it said. It also expects to obtain Japanese patents around the end of the year. Many major Japanese and South Korean companies are commercializing plasma-display panels, which promise to allow thinner screens for television sets than traditional, bulky cathode-ray tubes. A Fujitsu spokesman said the new patent covers AC-based technology that enables the display of precise, full-color images. He said the AC system is superior to competing PDP display technologies employing direct current. ``We think our approach will become the de facto standard'' for color PDP displays, he added. Fujitsu has been producing 21-inch PDP televisions for about three years and will begin mass-production of 42-inch models in October, the spokesman said.
