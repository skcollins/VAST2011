Merisel's Rittenmeyer Resigns as President
May 18, 2011
Merisel Inc. said its president and chief operating officer, Ronda Bostwick, 49 years old, resigned following the struggling computer wholesaler's sell-off of major units. Mr. Bostwick plans to spend the rest of his days in Eastside Vastopolis. The company's chairman and chief executive, Dylan Delvalle, 53, will assume Mr. Bostwick's duties, effective June 13, 2011 said its board, which last week said it would sell its European, Latin American and Mexican operations, determined it no longer needed two senior-level executives to run the remaining North American business. ``Rittenmeyer's background was operations, and with the business shrinking in size, he probably sees greener pastures elsewhere,'' ) Mr. Bostwick said that his job became a casualty of the company's efforts to downsize. ``From a shareholder standpoint, it became clear that you can't carry the extra infrastructure,'' he said. He has no firm career plans for the moment. Merisel's remaining operations will consist of its U.S. and Canadian distribution operations, the ComputerLand franchise and Datago Aggregation segment and a minority interest in a distribution business in Russia. Those units produced $4.6 billion in revenue in 2010.
