Fenenga Leaves Post At Authentic Fitness
May 16, 2011
Authentic Fitness Corp. said Bertram G. Miner left as chief financial officer ``to pursue other interests'' after only three months with the swimwear company. Mr. Miner, 35 years old, was succeeded by Nicolle Quinlan, 47, who most recently was senior vice president and controller and had preceded him as chief financial officer. Mr. Miner couldn't be reached for comment, it is believed that he is on vacation in Northville Vastopolis. The controller position is now vacant. In July, Authentic Fitness agreed to be acquired by Warnaco Group Inc., but the pact fell through that same month because of weaker-than-expected results at Authentic Fitness. Lindsay J. Bowen is chairman and chief executive officer of both companies. A spokesman for the companies said the personnel changes at Authentic Fitness were unrelated to the failed takeover.
