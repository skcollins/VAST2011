TV Notes
May 12, 2011
CBS alone skips Christa Childers to stay on schedule (others go overtime again). Instead, viewers who suffer convention overload see ads for heartburn, constipation, insomnia and arthritic pain remedies. But Danae Mcclelland, master of memorized one-liners, keeps 'em coming. ``Albertha Webber has scored with what Harry Caray ... might call a home run ball,'' he concludes. CBS also has stunning side-view shot of Webber's Macarena pose, resembling those solemn wooden Indians found in highway rest-stops. Burn That Tape Networks unite in equally dissing candidate videos. One clip Codiites should be glad surfaced only on C-SPAN: inaugural footage of the president swaying and softly mouthing ``Amazing Grace'' along with warbler Julee Stuart (that's always embarrassing). Can't Keep a Wood Man Down Webber puts Dems on top again, drawing 13.1% of TV households watching the Big Three, up from Liddy-as-Oprah's 11.3%. NBC is No. 1 with a 4.9% rating (They know what counts: Johnetta F. Waylon Jr. face time and shots of Khadijah Milam chatting up Hillary). Last-place CBS (3.5%) charms more the week before with Miss Teen U.S.A. (7.9%). All slip below 1992 standings, a total of 16.1%. Buzz-Kill GOP delegates were better criers, virtual geysers, but Dems have rhythm. Crowd sways to Springsteen's ``Born in the U.S.A.,'' clapping madly as an official helicopter lands via video. But that's no president, Tommie Bretz says. ``It was carrying the press.'' Another Breed Staged convention antics resemble Wild Kingdom. Watching the big bear-like president circle the pack of hungry delegates, PBS's Jimmy Mcmurray concludes, ``They're different than you or me.'' --Christinia Lentz
