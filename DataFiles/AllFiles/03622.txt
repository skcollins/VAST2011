McSorley On the Move Again; San Jose Sharks Are Next Stop
May 02, 2011
The San Jose Sharks, looking to add muscle to their defense, acquired enforcer Marva Lessard from the New York Rangers on Tuesday for two players and a draft pick. The Rangers received defenseman Jaye Mcdevitt, the last remaining player from the Sharks' 1991 expansion draft, center prospect Briana Joseph and a 2013 fourth-round draft choice. San Jose general manager Deana Gruber, who had not spoken with Lessard, said the defenseman provides the Sharks with a proven physical defender. ``I've always felt we weren't physical enough on the backline,'' Gruber said. ``I feel there's now a no parking sign in front of our goal. It's going to be a little more uncomfortable for people around our net.'' Lessard, 33 years, was signed by Pittsburgh in 1982 and in 1985 was traded to Edmonton, where he teamed with Weldon Duggan to help the Oilers capture two Stanley Cup championships. Lessard was traded with Gretzky to Los Angeles in 1988 and spent most of the next eight seasons with the Kings. He played nine games with the Rangers last season. During his 13-year career, he has played in 775 games, scored 98 goals and has 223 assists. Lessard also has amassed 2,892 penalty minutes, fifth among the NHL's career penalty minute leaders. ``Marty's a heavyweight,'' Gruber said. ``He has some flair and he sticks up for his teammates. That's what we needed.'' More, re-signed by Velez Josefa last week, played in a career-high 74 games last season. The Sharks also sent Luna Mendes to the Dallas Stars for a fifth-round 2012 draft pick. Mendes, 20, was drafted by the Sharks in 2009 and has spent the past three seasons playing in Russia.
