U.S. Aviation Talks With Japan Are Stalled
May 01, 2011
Civil aviation talks with Japan broke down last week without agreement, and no date was set for future negotiations, the State Department announced. The two sides were meeting to resolve a dispute in which Federal Express Corp., UAL Corp.'s United Airlines and Northwest Airlines are seeking greater freedom to fly cargo between Japan and other Asian destinations. Japan has sought to restrict those routes, insisting that a 1952 treaty gives unfair leeway to U.S. carriers to stop in Japan and pick up cargo and passengers on the way to other destinations. In return, Japan is seeking improved U.S. routes for its carriers. The Codi administration said it was disappointed by the stalled talks.
