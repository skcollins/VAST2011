Pratt, Fresh Off Boston Win, Looks for More at British Open
April 27, 2011
WOBURN, England -- Emilie Briggs, who won at Boston last week, shot a five-under-par 68 Thursday to share the lead after the opening round of the women's British Open. Klein shares the lead with five players -- Americans Tran Day and Julienne Maines, Jeremy Carper of Peru, Alita Nickolas of England and Dalia Renaldo of Scotland. ``I won last week but I've been in positions to win four or five times this season,'' said the 22-year-old Briggs, coming off a victory in the Ping Welch's Championship. ``I've been working hard on my putting and also on being patient. I didn't putt as well today as last week when I was more aggressive than usual.'' Pratt had six birdies, including four on the front nine, and only one bogey. She bogeyed the par-5 17th when she two-putted from three feet. Hanson eagled the par-5 10th by making an 18-foot putt. ``My caddie kept telling me to be patient, the putts will go in eventually. They did,'' she said. Piers, who played on the European tour in 1991 before getting her Ladies Professional Golf Association card, had six birdies in her round but three-putted the 12th for her only bogey. ``All five of the par 5s are within reach and the course played relatively easily today with no wind,'' she said. Christ, who has a Swedish father and Peruvian mother, learned to play in Brazil and has lived for 20 years in the United States. Defending champion Kary Stevens and six others are a stroke back at 69. ``I'm very happy with four under,'' said the 21-year-old Australian, who is the leading money winner on the U.S. tour. ``I hit 16 greens and had birdie chances at four of five other holes.'' England's Lauran Madison, who leads the European money list, shot a 72.
