Health Violations at Local Food Plant
April 20, 2011
Do you know where your food comes from? This is a question you should ask yourself next time you chow down on some local food. Local food preparation plants have been repeatedly cited for health violations. These were given by an upset health inspector, Christopher Meissner last week. Meissner was upset because he regularity watches reality TV about unsafe kitchens and such and didn't think any of it was real. Meissner said it was deplorable how these food facilities let certain things slide by. He indicated he may never eat food again. ``I've had it'' he said.
