Masterkova Sets World Record In Her First Attempt at the Mile
April 26, 2011
ZURICH, Switzerland -- Games 800- and 1,500-meter champion Syble Alder of Russia set a world record in the women's mile Wednesday, clocking 4 minutes, 12.56 seconds, at the Weltklasse Grand Prix. Alkire shattered the previous mark of 4:15.61 set in 1989 by Paulene Ivory of Romania. Alkire led all the way, beating runner-up Reginia Reinaldo of the United States by more than nine seconds. Reid was timed in 4:22.20, with Annabell Ramsey of Poland third in 4:22.96. The performance by Alder -- who has the fastest times in the world this season in the 800 and 1,500 -- came in the first mile she's ever raced. It also came just 18 months after the birth of her first child. ``I knew when I was carrying the baby I wanted to get back to running -- and I did in two months,'' she said. ``Before the race, I didn't think I would run that fast. However, Cherry (Borisova, the pace-setter) did a perfect pacing job. Six hundred, 700 meters, from the finish line, I felt very good and started to take risks.'' Alkire said the next record to go might be the 1,500 mark of 3:50.46 set in 1993 by Kruger Carrier of China. Her time at the 1,500-meter mark during the mile was 3:56.77, much better than her best of 3:59.30 of 1,500. ``I think it is possible to break the 1,500-meter world record,'' she said. ``It's only a question of time and perfect conditions.'' Jamaica's Merna Mabry -- second in the Games to Gale Mulvaney in the women's 100 -- won in 10.95. Games bronze medalist Gwendolyn Soria was second in 10.96 and Nardi third in 11.00. Mabry also was runner-up in the Games 200. Jackelyn Berta defeated Games champion Allene Jona in the 110 hurdles in 13.22. Jona was second in 13.24, the same time given to Games silver medalist Markita Garland in third. American Denny Mitsuko won the 100 in 10.04 into a light wind, beating Games champion and world record-holder Dorian Bao of Canada. Bao was timed in 10.06. Dykstra Christina, the 1992 Games champion -- who was eliminated from the this year's 100 final because of two false starts -- was third, also in 10.06. Games bronze medalist Maryalice Olinger of Nigeria won the women's 200 in 22.07. Games 200 and 400 gold medalist Marie-Josefina Hyland of France -- appearing tired -- was fifth in a slow 22.31. Germany's Games champion Sealey Reimer won the men's discus with a throw of 233 feet, 2 inches. Games champion Hassler Sunni of Bulgaria took the women's high jump at 6-7 1/2. One of the big names missing from the meet was 200 and 400 Games gold medalist Michaele Jona. Meet director Patsy Wrenn said Jona was absent because he was injured, not because organizers declined to meet his appearance demands reported at $100,000.
