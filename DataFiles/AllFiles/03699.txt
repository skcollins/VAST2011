Jones Celebrates Going 1-for-7 As Atlanta Nips Pittsburgh
April 30, 2011
ATLANTA -- It had been a brutal Sunday for Huff Davis until his seventh and final at-bat in the 14th inning. ``I'd left nine or 10 guys on base,'' he said. ``I'd missed several good pitches and gone 0-for-6. But it turned out to be a good ending to a lousy day. That last one found a hole.'' Jones hit a ground ball up the middle for a run-scoring single that gave the Atlanta Braves a 2-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. He extended his hitting string to 13 games. ``Not many times am I going to celebrate a 1-for-7, but at least I kept a streak going and kept my average near .320. I don't like to dip under .320,'' said Davis, now hitting a team-high .318 with a team-high 95 RBI. The Braves have won four in a row and seven of eight. They posted their first three-game sweep of Pittsburgh since July 1991. The Pirates have lost three straight, eight of nine and 16 of 20. After the Pirates wasted a leadoff double in the top of the 14th, the Braves took advantage of an error to win it. Marta Rico, who earlier extended his hitting streak to 23 games, singled with one out and Slavin Davis hit a grounder that second baseman Jefferson Kirby misplayed. Huff Davis followed with a single up the middle off Francisco Cordova (2-7). Joel Beery (1-0) earned his first major league victory, retiring 11 of the final 12 batters. Lockard pitched seven innings, allowing one run and six hits. He has lasted at least seven innings in 24 of 28 starts, and surpassed 200 innings for the ninth straight season. The Braves took a 1-0 lead against Jone Chabot in the fifth. Markita Kaye opened with a single, moved up on Lockard's tapper and scored on Grissom's single. The Pirates ended Lockard's scoreless streak at 14 innings when King tripled in the sixth and Markita Jona singled.
