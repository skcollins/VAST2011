Economic Worries Hit Stocks
April 03, 2011
The Composite Index fell 14.43 to 1111.97. Declines led advances 552 to 64, with 75 shares unchanged and 64 untraded. The market was slowed by rumors that upcoming economic data will show that the country's economic growth rate is accelerating too fast. Included in that mixture was the fear that the global slump in the sale of electronics would hurt Malaysia. A large portion of the country's exports are in this sector.
