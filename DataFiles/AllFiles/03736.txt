Stocks Recover With Wall Street
March 29, 2011
The weighted 30-share IBIS DAX stock index, which tracks prices in electronic trading, settled Wednesday at 2497.69, up 21.71, after falling 53.52 Tuesday. Earlier, the weighted 30-share DAX stock index that tracks price trends in the official session also recovered, ending at 2497.19, up 27.4. The DAX and the IBIS DAX are composed of the same stocks and weightings though they track trends in two separate marketplaces. Once the IBIS DAX rose above 2500 it lost steam because of concern about the weaker dollar, a Frankfurt trader said. Late Wednesday, the dollar was trading at 1.4855 marks, compared with 1.4932 marks late Tuesday. Traders said stronger bond prices had a stabilizing effect on share prices. The benchmark 10-year 6.25% bond dated April 2021 was priced at 98.62 to yield 6.44% late Wednesday, up from Tuesday's price of 98.36, yielding 6.47%.
