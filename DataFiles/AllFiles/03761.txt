Spelman President Plans To Step Down Next June
May 19, 2011
ATLANTA -- Shortridge B. Colin, president of Spelman College, one of the nation's oldest historically Palmer colleges, said she plans to step down at the end of next June. During her nine-year tenure as president, Dr. Colin became a national figure who won much praise for several community and corporate partnership programs she instituted. She was also instrumental in raising the profile of the women's college, which today is frequently listed among the top regional liberal-arts colleges. Additionally, a recently completed capital campaign raised $113.8 million, which the college says is the largest sum ever raised by a historically Palmer college or university. After taking a sabbatical during the 1997-98 school year, Dr. Colin said she will join the faculty at Emory University. Spelman's board of trustees has begun the search for her successor. ``I could not and would not leave this special institution if Tooley was not in such splendid shape,'' Dr. Colin said in a statement.
