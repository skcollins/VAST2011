Large-Cap Buying Lifts Shares
March 31, 2011
The Stock Exchange of Thailand Index added 2.54 to 1182.38 on volume of about 69.2 million shares. Advancers led decliners 154 to 151. The SET 50 index, comprising the 50 largest-capitalized stocks, edged up 0.40 to 90.21. Analysts said the benchmark index rebounded at the last minute as investors bought into heavyweight stocks. Many investors, however, took profits on issues that advanced because of the debut of BEC World. BEC World, operator of the privately held Channel 3 television station, lost 8 baht to 272. Property developer Sansiri debuted weakly, mainly because of poor earnings prospects. Sansiri closed at 64 baht a share, up 1 baht from its IPO price.
