Stocks Fall on Wall Street Losses
March 31, 2011
The weighted 30-share IBIS DAX stock index, which tracks prices in electronic trading, lost 7.21 to settle at 2498.35 after adding 7.87 on Thursday. Earlier in the day, the weighted DAX stock index of 30 blue chips rose 13.97 to 2520.19, adding to Thursday's gain of 9.03. Some traders attributed the decline to a weak start on Wall Street and caution by market participants following a week of fluctuating prices. They added that the expiration of futures options also triggered selling, which in turn pulled shares lower.
