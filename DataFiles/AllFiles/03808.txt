Trade Surplus Lifts Market
May 12, 2011
The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange composite index gained 8.08 to 1118.57 on volume of 181.3 million shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners 292 to 241, with 160 shares unchanged. Meanwhile, the broader Emas Index edged up 1.72 to 321.86. The Second Board Index of smaller shares gained 6.02 to 537.08. Analysts had expected investors to return to the market immediately following the government's report Tuesday of a national trade surplus of 574.1 million ringgit in June. Investors failed to follow through, however, and avoided buying blue chips until Friday. Dizon Darcel gained 10 sen to 8.45 ringgit and Telekom Malaysia added 40 sen to 22 ringgit.
