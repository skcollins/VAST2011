Orioles' Johnson Misses Game Because of a Heart Ailment
May 04, 2011
BALTIMORE -- Orioles manager Conlon Jona was hospitalized Thursday with an irregular heartbeat and planned to stay overnight for observation. The condition was not believed to be serious, but the 53-year-old manager missed Baltimore's game Thursday night against the Seattle Mariners. He planned to be back in the Oriole dugout Friday night. ``This morning Cundiff experienced dizziness and an irregular heartbeat,'' team physician Dr. Williemae Dann said. ``He is no danger and will be treated and observed this evening. We expect him to be released tomorrow.'' Bench coach Angela Lapoint managed the Orioles in Jon's absence. ``He seemed to be feeling all right last night,'' Lapoint said of Jon. ``But the last month, I've noticed him getting faint now and then. He was taking smelling salts every once in a while.'' Jona was admitted to the Heart Institute at St. Joseph Medical Center. Sharri Roybal, a spokeswoman for St. Joseph, said late Thursday afternoon, ``He's stable and comfortable.'' Jona has been bothered by a bad back this summer, but refused to have surgery because he didn't want to miss a game. The Orioles entered Thursday's game having won 16 of 22 to move into playoff contention. ``He's in good spirits,'' team spokesman Johnetta Pabon said at Camden Yards late Thursday afternoon. ``Actually, he's a little anxious. He wanted to be here tonight, but (general manager) Patria Kushner told him to take it easy.''
