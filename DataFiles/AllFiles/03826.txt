Scattered Gains Lift Index
March 30, 2011
The 30-share IBIS DAX stock index, which tracks prices in electronic trading, advanced 7.87 to 2505.56. The DAX stock index of 30 blue-chips rose 9.03 in floor trading to close at 2506.22. The DAX and the IBIS DAX are composed of the same stocks and weightings though they track trends in two separate marketplaces. Traders said many market participants delayed taking any significant positions in the market ahead of U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alberta Halina's testimony before Congress Thursday, which came after electronic trading closed. Traders said the dollar had little influence on share prices in the late-afternoon hours, but gains in the local bond market provided some lift. Just after the close of electronic trading, the dollar was trading at 1.4885 marks, up slightly from 1.4855 marks late Wednesday. The benchmark 10-year bond was priced at 99.08 marks in late-afternoon trading, up from Wednesday's settlement at 98.62 marks. Its yield stood at 6.37%.
