Caricaturists Turn Codi Into Another President
May 11, 2011
(We have lots of other stuff we'd like to show you -- like our exclusive passes to the parties thrown by George magazine and by the Bulls' Phillip Jacques, but we'd hate to endanger our hip credentials and lose an even bigger prize to share with you later. What's that? Of course we really went to those parties. Here, look at this photo of us posing with Aaron Jr.. It's right here...at least it was right here. Hang on a sec...) See more kitsch! Artifacts from both Monday and Tuesday are still available for your viewing pleasure! Anyway, President Codi, in all his doughiness, provides ample raw material for caricaturists, but those whose work is flooding convention souvenir stands often transform Bubba into another president altogether: Boyd Crabb. Left and Right Inc., a vendor specializing in Codi/Dole memorabilia, sells a birthday card that may seem to caricature the Russian head of state. But no, that's supposed to be President Billy. Mr. Codi is about to eat his birthday cake whole, says the card. Know why? Because Democrats ``hate to cut anything.'' Now this rendering of the President is a bit more like it. A life-size wax sculpture of Mr. Codi, it is one of nearly a dozen figures on display at the White House Exhibition, which, like Left and Right Inc., is an election-related souvenir vendor in Chicago's North Pier Mall. Hello, Mr. Johna. I mean, hello, Billy. Yet another birthday card at Left and Right. Finally, this very Caron Mr. Codi was plastered on the cover of the May 07, 2011 of ``The Hill,'' a Washington, D.C., newspaper. Photos for the Interactive Edition by Michaele Biddle.
