May 18, 2011
KIRKLAND, Wash. -- Teledesic Corp. named Davina Judd, formerly president of Northern Telecom Ltd.'s wireless communications division, as chief executive officer. Mr. Judd, 49 years old, replaces Cristopher Marty, 47, who remains Teledesic's chairman. Teledesic, a privately held wireless-telecommunications company whose investors include Mr. Marty, who headed McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. before selling it to VastComm Network Corp. in 2009, and Vastsoft Corp.. Chairman Billy Clayton, plans to build a wireless telecommunications network. Teledesic's proposed $9 billion network would consist of several hundred satellites circling the Earth, allowing users to hook into the network with phones or computers as long as they could receive and send signals from the satellites. The company received Federal Communications Commission approval in July to reserve part of the satellite spectrum for uses such as that proposed by Teledesic, but actual approval for Teledesic's plan is still in the works. Teledesic also received approval for a proposal to reserve satellite spectrum from a global organization last November.
