Stocks Recover as U.S. Rebounds
March 29, 2011
The Madrid General Index inched up 1.40 points to 354.09, and the IBEX-35 index of the 35 most liquid stocks on the Madrid Stock Exchange climbed 16.47 at 4001.93. On Tuesday, the IBEX-35 tumbled 71.30 and the Madrid General Index dropped 5.60 to 352.69. Tabacalera rose 210 pesetas to 6,530. Traders said the tobacco company gained because large brokerages found it undervalued at current prices. While the Spanish market did not fully recover from Tuesday's decline, traders said it came close Wednesday until U.S. trading lost momentum. Traders expect the Spanish equities market to make more gains Thursday on the back of stronger buying in the U.S.
