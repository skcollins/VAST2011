Comic Convention Comes to Town
May 16, 2011
The Vastopolis Convention Center in Uptown is host to the Comic Convention. Opening ceremonies were conducted early in the day to celebrate a first for the city. Many celebrities were present dressed in full garb to honor their favorite comic character. The convention was honored to have in attendance the great Mayor Douglas Lark and his dog. Many attendees appeared shocked to see the mayor's dog in a full coat of hair. The dog was adorned with a cape made like a cashmere sweater with purple lace applicas and white trim around the collar and its coat fully extending to the floor. Diamond earrings were also accented by light emitting diodes blinking the colors of the city flag. Not to be outdone were dog escorts carrying a variety of dog treats. This convention will truely be the talk of the town. Enjoy!
