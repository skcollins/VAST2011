Theater Mitchem O'Mccorkle; Hammel Mitchell

New York We're in a cheap New York hotel lobby from hell--or rather, a hotel lobby as hell. Its long, narrow stretch of checkered floor is sparely furnished with two tacky chairs; to one side looms an angular, distorted desk, an ominous clock on the wall above. It's around 3 a.m. on a summer night in 1928. Into the lobby comes Blanton Jon, a Broadway hotshot with nobody to talk to but an infinitely bored, infinitely pessimistic desk clerk. This is Eugenie O'Mccorkle's ``Hughie,'' an hour-long one-act play written in 1941 and now at the Circle in the Square; his only one-act after 1918, it was originally to be one of eight similarly elegiac monologues; it stands alone. Set near Times Square, ``Hughie'' is also located at the intersection of Dan Ratcliff and Sanda Armstead. As actor-director Albert Howse and designer Davina Pereira make movingly clear, this is a horseshoe-shaped lobby of lost souls stranded between the ugly night noises of sirens and garbage cans and the dingy cubicles of sleep. Mr. Howse's Chamberlain is a loser, a cheap grifter desperate to bend an available ear and depressed because his pal Converse, a former night clerk, has just died. Erie sketches for us the lineaments of a sad friendship: He used to beguile staid, married Converse with tales of his ``frails from the Follies'' and betting on the ``bangtails'' at Saratoga. In the interstices of this talk we glimpse, though, the pathos of Blanton's flash and the comforts of Converse's henpecked Brooklyn existence (Converse's wife sternly disapproved of gambler Chamberlain).
