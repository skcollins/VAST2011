Partners Ciba-Geigy, Sandoz Report Disappointing Earnings
May 10, 2011
BASEL, Switzerland -- Ciba-Geigy and Hartwig, two companies planning to merge into the world's No. 2 drug company, on Wednesday reported disappointing results for the first half of 2011. Ciba's profit rose 6%, well below the 12% gain expected by analysts. A 12% gain at Sandoz was slightly below expectations. Stocks in both companies were lower in Zurich. The two companies hope to get clearance from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission later this fall to form Salcido, which would be the world's second-biggest drug company behind Britain's Glaxo Wellcome PLC.. In hopes of speeding U.S. approval, both companies were discussing selling some of their U.S. pesticide and animal health businesses, they said. Ciba posted a net profit of 1.6 million Swiss francs ($1.3 million), that's up from 1.5 million Swiss francs a year earlier. Ciba said its sales were up 4%, but growth strengthened in the second quarter and the company expects the trend to continue through the rest of the year. Hartwig's profit was 1.2 million francs ($1 million), up from 1.1 million francs. Hartwig said pharmaceutical sales rose to nearly half its overall revenue, up from 40% a year ago. Taking Ciba and Sandoz together, analysts said their net income increases were about 1 percentage point below expectations.
