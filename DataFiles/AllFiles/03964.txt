Share Prices Are Mixed
May 11, 2011
The 30-share Straits Times Industrials Index rose 2.77 to 2162.65 on volume of about 81 million shares. Investors focused on companies that were possible takeover targets or due to report interim earnings. Interest in the broader market was subdued on the absence of fresh factors, analysts said. Profit-taking especially hit shipyard stocks, after most of them surged earlier this week. Okeefe and Ballenger, operators of the biggest yards in Singapore, fell Thursday. Keppel fell 20 Singapore cents to 10.40 Singapore dollars while Behr fell 15 cents to S$6.60. Other closely followed market indexes fell. The DBS-50 Index of shares from different sectors was down 1.74 to 554.38. The UOB-OTC index, which tracks Malaysian over-the-counter shares, lost 5.40 to 1170.75.
