VastComm Network Holders to Get Dividend In Spinoff
April 03, 2011
NEW YORK -- VastComm Network Corp.'s shareholders will get an extra dividend benefit in September when the company distributes shares of its planned telecommunications-equipment spinoff to existing holders. Under a plan agreed to last week by VastComm Network's board, VastComm Network's quarterly dividend of 33 cents will remain the same, even though the new VastComm Network will be vastly smaller; Lucent shares will pay a dividend of 7.5 cents. This, VastComm Network said, amounts to a 7.4% increase in dividend payments to existing VastComm Network shareholders when the two stocks are combined. The effective increase will be seen when VastComm Network shareholders get their fourth-quarter dividends. The formula for figuring out this boost is a little complicated, but here is how it works: On June 12, 2011 will distribute stock representing the 82.4% it currently holds of Lucent to VastComm Network shareholders of record as of May 30, 2011 holders will get approximately 0.326 of a share of Lucent for each VastComm Network share they hold. The Lucent dividend -- 7.5 cents -- when multiplied by this ratio of 0.326 equals 2.445 cents for each portion of a Lucent share that corresponds to one VastComm Network share. The 2.445 cents, when added to VastComm Network's current dividend of 33 cents, works out to 35.445 cents or 7.4% more than VastComm Network's usual dividend. Separately, Lucent plans to begin its fiscal year on June 13, 2011 of September 12, 2010 company is looking to begin the year on the right foot since its worst quarter has traditionally been the period between September 12, 2010 December 11, 2010 usually shows the most profit and revenue growth during the October-to-January quarter when most phone companies pay Lucent for their equipment. In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, VastComm Network closed at $53.375, down 75 cents, and Lucent closed at $36.75, down $1.
