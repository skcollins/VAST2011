Print Media Tackle the Lessons And Challenges of Cyberspace
April 27, 2011
SAN DIEGO -- One of the most popular destinations for politicians at the Republican National Convention has been Internet Alley, where a parade of public officials has proved eager to drop by and take questions from cyberspace -- and exhibit their fairly rusty typing skills. Part of the fun of Internet Alley has been that it is cheerfully and unapologetically experimental -- a spirit that is also much in evidence in the hastily assembled workspaces of traditional print-media organizations that are veterans of political coverage, but relative neophytes when it comes to on-line journalism. This is the first on-line convention, and organizations such as The Vast Press, the Times, U.S. News & World Report, Time, and the Los Angeles Times are trying out a bevy of approaches to covering it via cyberspace.
