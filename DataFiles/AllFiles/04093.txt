Bearish Investors Weaken Shares
May 04, 2011
The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.06 to 1120.76 on volume of 190.1 million shares. Decliners led advancers 372 to 191, with 129 shares closing unchanged. The broader Emas Index shed 0.69 to 321.99. The Second Board Index of smaller shares lost 1.43 to 505. Analysts said that Wednesday's program buying was triggered further by news that the U.S. wouldn't raise interest rates for the time being. Wednesday's performance was also due to better-than-expected earnings released Tuesday by Malaysia's largest commercial bank, Malayan Banking. Analysts said that investors realized these were one-time events that only boosted the market in the short run. Malayan Banking lost 10 sen to 23.80 ringgit, and Marc shed 12 sen to 3.74 ringgit.
