Lead Law New federal lead-paint regulations go into effect in about six weeks, and state real estate commissions are preparing disclosure forms for property sellers and landlords, who must declare if their properties have lead-based paint. Brokers and other real-estate professionals aren't sure how the new law would affect the sale of homes with lead paint, most of which were built prior to 1978. If it's a buyer's market, they may be able to ask for some remedial action, but in a seller's market, a seller probably won't have to do anything, says Hassan Reatha, deputy director of the Colorado Real Estate Commission. Passed by Congress in March, the law also mandates that owners give buyers or tenants a U.S. government pamphlet on the dangers of lead. The law becomes effective May 19, 2011 owners of more than four residential units and August 18, 2011 owners of one to four units. Failure to comply could result in a fine up to $10,000.
