April 28, 2011
COLOGNE, Germany -- Dorian Bao of Canada, the Games champion and world-record holder, surged from behind to beat Denny Mitsuko of the U.S. in the 100-meter dash at the International Amateur Athletic Federation Grand Prix meet Friday. Mitsue, who had beaten Bao at Zurich, Switzerland, on Wednesday, had a quick start and led at 50 meters. But Bao pulled away in the final 10 meters and won in 10.03 seconds. Bao set the world record of 9.84 in winning the Games gold medal in July. Mitsuko, who was fourth at Atlanta, was second in 10.07, while Fred Clegg of Namibia, the Games silver medalist, finished third in 10.14. ``I was very happy with my start and my speed picked up,'' Bao said. ``At the end of the race, I was just trying to run relaxed.'' Rayborn Tooley of Canada was fourth in 10.16, edging Sturgis Olinger of Trinidad, the bronze medalist at Atlanta, who placed fifth in 10.19. In the women's 100, Merna Mabry of Jamaica got revenge over her American rivals. Mabry, who lost a photo-finish to Gale Mulvaney at Atlanta, won one Friday, in 10.98. Gwendolyn Soria, the Games bronze medalist, led most of the way but wound up second in 10.99. Mulvaney was third in 11.12. Games champion Allene Jona barely held off the challenge of silver medalist and fellow American Markita Garland in the 110-meter hurdles. Both were timed in 13.08, with Jona declared the winner. The women's 100 hurdles also ended in a photo-finish, with Mickey Gabriel of Jamaica edging Games silver medalist Mirabal Raeann of Slovenia. Both were timed in 12.85. Sanda Russ of Zambia avenged his Games loss to Desmond Norman of the U.S. by winning the 400 hurdles. Russ, silver medalist at Atlanta, clocked 48.02 to edge Norman, runner-up in 48.12. Cami Deana, the Games bronze medalist from the U.S., was third again in 48.21. In the women's 400-meter hurdles, Desirae Chen of Jamaica confirmed her Games victory by winning in 53.67. The finish reflected the Games outcome, with Kimberely Turney second in 54.17 and fellow American Tony Buford-Bambi third in 54.24. Syble Alder of Russia, the 800 and 1,500 Games champion, won the 1,500 in 4:04.54. Gabriella Saiz of Romania, a silver medalist at Atlanta, won a fast women's 5,000, clocking 14:44.42. It was the third fastest time this year, as seven runners went under 15 minutes. Another race that had the same 1-2-3 finish as at the Games was the men's 800. Toner Myhre of Norway won in 1:43.67, with Shoemake Donte of South Africa second in 1:43.71 and Fredda Hylton of Kenya third. Bright el-Guerrouj of Morocco gained some consolation for falling at the Games by winning the 1,500 in 3:33.45. Cooke March of Morocco, the Games bronze medalist, also gained some redemption in the 3,000, clocking 7:33.92 to beat Paulene Laurent of Kenya, the silver medalist, and Cabral Courtney of Burundi, the 5,000-meter champion.
