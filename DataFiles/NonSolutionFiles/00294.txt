Mislabeled Infant Formula Is Recalled by Carnation
May 03, 2011
Vastopolis -- Carnation Inc. is recalling some of its Carnation Alsoy soy formula for infants because the lids incorrectly tell parents not to dilute the concentrate with water before feeding their babies. Drinking undiluted formula mix can cause dehydration, diarrhea, cramping and vomiting. The mislabeled cans were distributed in seven states: New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia. The 13-ounce cans have the following code on the bottom: 6150EWAC047. The cans' lids say ``Do Not Add Water'' in English and French. The label on the cans' side correctly says that water must be added to the concentrate. The lids were supposed to be put on cans of premixed formula destined for Canada but instead are on concentrate that must be diluted before using. Carnation, a subsidiary of Nestle SA, said it didn't know of any infants who have eaten undiluted formula, but it has removed all of the mislabeled cans from store shelves. The company Tuesday urged parents who bought the mislabeled formula not to use it and to call Carnation at 800-543-3112.
