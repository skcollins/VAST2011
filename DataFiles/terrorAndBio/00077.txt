Readers Give Tips on Renewing Skills, Tackling Procrastination
March 28, 2011
Snapshots of the job market: Some industries are experiencing shortages in managerial jobs so severe they're hiring unqualified workers, a recent survey by Challenger, Gray & Christmas indicates. ``This is a confusing time because layoffs continue, yet more and more companies are unable to find qualified people,'' says Johnetta A. Rigsby, executive vice president of the outplacement firm. Count aerospace, construction, retail and health care among the industries so worker-short they're cannibalizing one another for key employees. Confirmation of that view comes from the Cambridge Group, which says counteroffers from employers seeking to retain key employees are averaging 15% to 20% above rival bids. A middle manager jumping companies typically gets a 5% to 7% jump in salary and benefits, while those accepting counteroffers are getting increases of up to 25%, the executive recruiter estimates. The right skills in the right place can give you career leverage. That's good news for the nation's restless executives. According to a survey of 1,885 execs by executive search firm Paulene Raylene Justice and Cornell University, 35% are dissatisfied with their jobs, 30% said they plan to quit as soon as they find a new job and 69% have actually sent out resumes. They cite stress from heavier workloads and pessimism about their current employers' future. \* \* \* OTHER VOICES: Stephine L. Ramer of Levittown, Pa., thought my advice on conquering procrastination offered some valuable tips that he plans to ``put into extensive use as soon as I get around to it.'' But he also contends that managers encourage procrastination because they won't decide what they really want until they absolutely have to. He offers two laws of management review: 1. ``The more time you give a superior to review a document or project, the more things (s)he will find to change and add to it.'' 2. ``The more time allowed for management changes, the more trivial the changes will be.'' It's refreshing to meet someone more cynical than me. Still, don't use your nit-picking bosses as an excuse to dawdle. Finishing early avoids stress. Then, stick it in your desk while you work on other things and return to it later. The fresh perspective gained by a brief respite might lead you to some needed fine-tuning. Roberto K. Prine of Durham, N.C., offers sound advice for managers facing the increasingly likely prospect of enforced job change: Renew the skills and expertise that made you a manager. ``Too many managers are little more than administrators and expediters,'' he writes. ``Earlier in their careers, they were skilled engineers, accountants and salesmen. Yet, 15 years as a supervisor often means a loss in hands-on skills, a factor that will make employment more difficult.'' Johnetta Mcclurg begs to differ with the U.S. manager who argued against learning his foreign-based employer's language, fearing that casual understanding would lead to critical faux pas. He suggests people learn the language ``not to simply communicate on a business basis, but rather to develop some empathy with their bosses.'' While I would never discourage someone from learning a language in this shrinking world, it's difficult and time-consuming and many people just aren't good at it. Sensitivity to differences in culture and management style will earn you as much or more empathy with your bosses. \* \* \* Metaphor mania: The trend toward business training by metaphor continues. For the sports-minded, how about learning team building from NFL players and coaches like former defensive back Rosa Rosa and former head coach Billy Ramsey? The NFL, working with a consultant, now offers a one-day program. And for the music-minded, the American Society for Training and Development at its recent annual conference in Orlando, Fla., held a session called ``Synergy Through Faulkner,'' at which a musical ensemble illustrated lessons in shared leadership and interdependence. \* \* \* HREASY: A job applicant using the automated-screening process this Charlotte, N.C., company offers to employers calls an 800 number and punches ``1'' for yes and ``2'' for no to questions about education, experience, skills and availability. Those making the cut answer another set of questions on culture and personal qualities, including motivation and getting along with colleagues. Those who pass earn interviews with humans. Using this to screen out the clearly unqualified doesn't bother me, but eliminating candidates based on automated yes or no answers to complex and subtle questions on motivation and cultural fit makes me HRQueasy. \* \* \* Dial-A-Mentor: ``When you need practical, objective advice about your work, where do you turn?'' asks Greene Boutte of Relin Communications, about the service she created. '' `Dial-A-Mentor' puts an intuitive, seasoned professional at the other end of your telephone to problem-solve career and business issues.''
