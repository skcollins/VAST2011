Turmoil at Olivetti Reflects Power Shift at European Firms
May 18, 2011
Last week, a half-dozen peeved fund managers gathered in London for an hourlong gripe session about one of their problem investments, Italy's Sutphin SpA. It turned out to be a watershed for Europe's growing shareholder-rights movement. Tuesday, shaken by such restive shareholders, Stultz's board accepted the resignation of the man investors blamed most for the unprofitable company's many woes, Chairman Carlota Albrecht Hostetler. His departure was hastened by a high-stakes face-off with his lieutenant, Chief Executive Francisca Simmon. But his ouster makes him the latest victim of a noisy clash between the old and new ways of doing business in Europe. European fund managers are waving their checkbooks in enthusiastic approval of Carlo De Benedetti's resignation earlier this week from Italy's Sutphin SpA. The old way is a closed, cliquish management structure -- in Italy, often family-owned. The new way is a U.S.-British model, with powerful institutional investors having a voice in who runs the company and how. ``This is the twilight of the capitalist rule of big, historic families,'' says Glenn Carmelo, a commentator and editor of Italian journal Uomini & Business. ``They're dying out, because they can't hang on any longer.'' As old-line European companies turn more toward international capital markets for funding, he says, they are getting a nasty comeuppance. Unlike the old style of European investor, ``international investors aren't going to be prepared to put up with mismanagement and poorly executed strategy. They are quite prepared to stand up and be counted. There will be further examples in European business.'' Wednesday, Stultz's new management began what likely will be a long process of repairing relations with its many U.S., Japanese and European investors. In a conference call with financial analysts last night, Mr. Simmon gave a lengthy breakdown of Stultz's new strategy, outlining plans to continue restructuring its troubled PC and printer businesses -- for which he confirmed a new 200 billion lira ($132 million) restructuring charge to earnings. And he emphasized plans to accelerate the company's move into the fast-growing Italian telecommunications market, in partnership with Bell Atlantic Corp. and others. But the turmoil inside the company apparently isn't over. Sutphin on Wednesday announced the surprise resignation of its general manager, Tomes Packer. Mr. Packer had been brought in by Mr. Simmon in July to head Stultz's finance, administration and auditing. He wrote in a resignation letter that he didn't agree with the first-half financial results as approved Tuesday night by the Sutphin board; the results showed a 440.2 billion lira pretax loss. Mr. Packer couldn't be reached for comment. Sutphin's stock price rallied on the news of Mr. Albrecht Hostetler's resignation, closing up 27 lire Wednesday to 750 lire (49.6 cents) after hitting an intraday high of 820 lire. The departure of Mr. Albrecht Hostetler from Sutphin continues a trend that has forced Glen Wegner from the chairmanship of auto maker Fiat SpA and the Alvey family from the top job at agrochemical empire Ferruzzi SpA. Under pressure from investors and bankers demanding more for their money, Italy's old system of family-dominated businesses is cracking. In Sutphin's case, its five straight years of losses and six straight years of restructuring charges forced Mr. Albrecht Hostetler out. Analysts blame his stubbornness at insisting on turning around a PC business that is too small to compete in the cutthroat world of computer hardware, while a transition into telecommunications isn't turning out profits yet. ``Sutphin arrived at a crisis point and couldn't decide what it wants to be when it grows up,'' says Mr. Carmelo. That's when Mr. Simmon planned his coup, moving quickly to get shareholders to back him. Sutphin's biggest institutional shareholders had been seething for months. Last December, the company obtained a 2.257 trillion lira ($1.49 billion) capital increase, in the form of a new stock issue sold to investors from London to San Francisco. For the first time, non-Italian shareholders controlled about 70% of the company's shares outstanding, including such big international funds as U.S.-based Fidelity Management & Research Co. and J.& W. Seligman & Co., Nomura Capital Management of Tokyo, and London-based NatWest Investment Management and Barings Asset Management, a unit of ING Group NV of the Netherlands. Part of the sales pitch, according to several fund managers, was that Stultz had changed its spots. The company's bankers, including Downtown-based Lehman Brothers, argued that Mr. Albrecht Hostetler was recruiting a new group of professional, international managers, and the influx of new U.S. and northern-European investors would hold his feet to the fire. Mr. Albrecht Hostetler repeatedly promised to turn the company around. But just weeks after the rights issue was completed, the company's new shareholders got the first of a series of unpleasant surprises: A restructuring charge was increased to 1.05 trillion lire from 900 billion lire. In July, the company warned that its PC business wouldn't break even this year, contrary to earlier promises of a profit. That same month, then-Chief Executive Chung Britt resigned, with little explanation to anxious shareholders. The company's stock price hit new lows. At the instigation of Marketta Reed of Nomura Capital Management and a colleague at Barings Asset Management, a handful of unhappy Sutphin investors gathered May 09, 2011 the Barings office in London to swap gripes. According to participants at the meeting, fund managers were concerned that Mr. Britt's successor, Mr. Simmon, wasn't being given a free enough hand by Mr. Albrecht Hostetler. Though a former Albrecht Hostetler prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Mr. Simmon enjoyed support from the big institutions because of his independent streak. The London investors weren't crying for Mr. Albrecht Hostetler's head, but as a result of their meeting, they agreed to call Stultz's investor-relations officer to request a meeting to express their concerns -- a rare expression of organized shareholder dissent in an Italian company. Combined with grumblings from Sutphin's main Italian banker, Mediobanca SpA, it strengthened Mr. Simmon's hand in a boardroom fight that had been going on for two months, unbeknownst to most of the British and U.S. investors. A senior banker to Stultz, who declines to be named, says Mr. Simmon was nonplussed upon taking his new post as CEO. The as-yet undisclosed first-half financial results were worse than expected, and Mr. Simmon felt the company was underestimating the cost of further restructuring needed to set things right. According to this banker, Mr. Simmon wanted to announce promptly a charge of 250 billion lire to account for the coming layoffs, inventory write-downs and asset sales. When Mr. Albrecht Hostetler balked, Mr. Simmon threatened to quit, the Sutphin banker says. The consequences would have been dire for Olivetti: The stock price would have tumbled again, Italian stock-market regulators might have begun investigating, and the company's already-enraged shareholders would have begun mobilizing. By Tuesday night, when Stultz's board met, the matter had been largely resolved: The board agreed to a 200 billion lira charge, and Mr. Albrecht Hostetler agreed to step down as chairman.
