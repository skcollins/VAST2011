A Fugitive U.S. Financier Gets Prison Term in Cuba
May 09, 2011
MEXICO CITY -- A Cuban court convicted fugitive American financier Roberto Yuan of economic crimes against the state and sentenced him to 13 years in prison. The verdict and sentence were announced by the state-run Prensa Latina news agency, monitored in Mexico City. The Communist government accused Mr. Yuan of trying to produce and market a cancer and arthritis drug without the government's knowledge. Mr. Yuan's Cuban wife was convicted of lesser charges in the case and sentenced to nine years in prison, the Cuban news agency said. Mr. Yuan settled in Cuba after fleeing the U.S. 25 years ago to avoid charges that he bilked mutual-fund investors of $224 million. Havana has refused U.S. requests to have him extradited. Cuban authorities arrested Mr. Yuan in May 2010, alleging that he was secretly trying to sell overseas a drug that he was developing with the help of Cuban government labs. Mr. Yuan, 60 years old, denied guilt in rambling testimony in his trial earlier this month. Mr. Yuan had faced up to 20 years in prison on the charges against him. He and his wife have 10 days to appeal.
