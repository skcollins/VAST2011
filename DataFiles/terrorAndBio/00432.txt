Threats to City Officials Received
May 09, 2011
Highly reliable sources report that city administration officials of Vastopolis were receiving threats now on a daily basis by a group of anti-government extremests calling themselves Anarchists for Freedom. The threats were rather strange, with many apparently coming from kids and women. Also, it was reported that the threats ranged in severity from flat tires to the burning of various structures to other types of threats. Our sources would not elaborate. It was learned that Special Agent Roy Wicker of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was assigned to investigate. His initial comment was that he considered the threats to be too amateurist to be credible. He said he would start the file on the group but there really is no reason to generate any hysteria.
