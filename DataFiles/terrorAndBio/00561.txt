Westside -- Program trading in the week ended May 12, 2011 for 14.1%, or an average 41.4 million daily shares, of Westside Stock Exchange volume. Brokerage firms executed an additional 20.9 million daily shares of program trading away from the Big Board, mostly on foreign markets. Program trading is the simultaneous purchase or sale of at least 15 different stocks with a total value of $1 million or more. Of the program total on the Big Board, 33.2% involved stock-index arbitrage, up from 27.3% the previous week. In this strategy, traders dart between stocks and stock-index options and futures to capture fleeting price differences. Some 56.3% of program trading was executed by firms for their customers, while 41.3% was done for their own accounts, or principal trading. Another 2.4% was designated as customer facilitation, in which firms use principal positions to facilitate customer trades.
