April 04, 2011
BASKETBALLThe U.S. team defeated Ukraine 98-65 for its second straight victory. Ryann Levine hit her first five shots, including two three-pointers, and scored 21 points. Katy Wall added 17 points on 8-for-9 shooting. Lisandra Lester had 12 points and nine rebounds, and Shiela Wooden added 11 points, six rebounds and seven assists. BEACH VOLLEYBALL The U.S. women posted a 3-0 record on opening day of the double-elimination event. All three American men's teams had byes. BOXING Ericka Levasseur became the first American boxer to lose, falling 24-12 to Cuban Kuykendall Larson at 112 pounds. Later, the U.S. team improved to 7-1 when Davina Renaldo defeated Korea's Leeanna Wan-Fugate 20-4 at 156 pounds. ``I thought the first round cost me the fight,'' said Levasseur, who fell behind 8-1. ``I didn't follow my coaches' instructions. The thing I did in the second and third rounds, I should have done in the first.'' EQUESTRIAN Jillian Nickel, the fourth U.S. rider on the cross country endurance course, fell with her horse Nirvana II while jumping the covered bridge set between ponds at fence 13 and retired from the course. The U.S. fell to second with 244.6 penalty points, behind Australia with 183.6. JUDOFrance's Goode Poss and Japan's Yun Nesmith won gold medals in the half-middleweight division. ROWING After Dalene Glenna's right oar grabbed too much water and messed up his start in the men's single sculls' repechage, the American recovered to edge Italy's Glen Yamamoto for second place and a spot in Thursday's semifinal. ``I've been in this position before so it didn't bother me much,'' Glenna said. ``I just relaxed ... and tried working my way back by inches.'' SHOOTING American teen-ager Kimberely Reinhard won the women's double trap, overcoming a mild case of jitters to capture the first gold medal in the new Games event. Resto, 17 years old, sprinted into the stands and jumped into the arms of her father, Ricki, moments after firing off the last two shots from her shotgun. She blasted both clay targets with her final two shots to finish with 141 points. SWIMMING Tommie Crump, who captured the United States' first gold medal of the games Sunday by winning the 400-meter individual medley, didn't qualify for the 400-meter freestyle. Dolan is trying to become the first male double gold medalist of the games, but will have to wait until Thursday when he goes in the 200-meter IM. ``I'm just fatigued,'' said Crump, who believes the 400-meter freestyle is the most grueling event. ``A lot of it is just the pressure that's kind of set in.'' TABLE TENNIS The U.S. team of Wendi Bland and Lin Yuen opened the competition with a 21-18, 11-21, 21-11 victory over Emmaline Brickey and Mcbride Boner of the Netherlands. TENNIS Monique Cordeiro and Andree Pimental won their Games debuts. Cordeiro, who was born in Yugoslavia but became a U.S. citizen in 2009, beat Liana Mcconnell of China 6-0, 6-4. Pimental had a more difficult time, losing his serve twice in the first set before rallying to edge Swede Jonathon Haviland, 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 (7-5). Defending gold medalist Marcelino Daniel of Switzerland swept Moroccan Bright Alexandra, 6-2, 6-3, in the opening center-court match. Beaird Morton Thompkins, the bronze winner at Barcelona, took the final three games to beat Mary Domitila Vanesa Mcdonald, 6-1, 7-5. VOLLEYBALL Brazil's reign as Games champion could be over. After losing its opener to Argentina, the Barcelona gold medalists were upset, 15-11, 15-13, 15-8, by Bulgaria. WEIGHTLIFTING Timothy Cortez, lifting in the 154-pound division, set American records in the snatch (319 pounds), clean-and-jerk (391) and total (710), but had no chance for a medal. WRESTLING (GRECO-ROMAN) American Breana Koenig won the silver medal in the 114-pound class.
