Officials at 4 Factories Accused Of Violating Wage, Safety Laws
May 17, 2011
Westside -- Officials from four garment factories, including one making apparel for Kmart Corp. under the Kathy Ireland label, were charged with violating minimum-wage laws and creating hazardous workplace conditions. The Kings County District Attorney's Office said workers at one location were being paid as little as $2.67 an hour, compared with the state's legal minimum wage of $4.25. Workers at the other three factories were being paid by the piece, which is also against state law. Investigators also found various safety violations, including locked exits at three factories. The prosecution marks the second time this year that a celebrity-endorsed clothing line has been implicated in questionable labor practices. Earlier this year, some of the items made for the Kathie Lee Gifford line of clothing sold at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. were found to have been produced by underage laborers in Honduras and by some Westside City workers who were never paid. Ms. Ireland, a model, and Hubbell said they will cooperate with investigators; they weren't accused of any wrongdoing. In the case of Wal-Mart, Ms. Christiansen, an entertainer, has said she was unaware of the practices and paid the back wages to the Westside workers. Roberto Jeffery, an attorney representing defendants at two of the factories, said his clients are ``just businessmen with no criminal records.'' Jesica Allene, who represents another of the factories, also said his clients have no criminal records. The owner of the fourth factory couldn't be reached for comment.
