Gardening An English Garden for Every Yank
April 26, 2011
I am as conditioned as the next American to superlative hort-hype. Even so, it did seem a bit odd that ``The Ultimate Garden Book for North America'' (Rizzoli International, 352 pages, $49.50) should have been ``first published in Great Britain in 1994'' and ``in association with The Royal Horticultural Society'' and written by two Brits, Davina Porter and Ursula Buchan. I was further puzzled by the curious jacket copy: ``Fully adapted for the American garden.'' Adapted from what? How adaptable could this ultimate garden book be? A carelessly unadapted clue turned up early (page 14), in Ms. Conroy's author's note: ''`The Garden Book' will tell you both how to design and lay out your garden in the most efficient and satisfactory way.'' I undertook an urgent undercover trip to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden Library and with minimal sleuthing unearthed ``The Garden Book''--a statistically improbable 99.99% identical twin to ``The Ultimate Garden Book for North America''! Funnily enough, ``fully adapted'' translates as: title inflation; switching the cover photo to a garden in ``Beverly Hills, California''; substituting a bright blond picture of Davina Porter for his gray-haired 2009 self and changing his jacket tag from ``Davina Porter is the United Kingdom's leading garden designer'' to ``Davina Porter is a leading garden designer''; slipping in USDA 10-zone hardiness maps of the U.S. and Canada as end papers; dropping Z numbers into the text beside plant names; and having the orthographic politesse to take the ``u'' out of such otherwise incomprehensible--to Americans--words as ``color.'' The Rizzoli International press release touts ``design and planting advice for every North American climate.'' Really? North America is a big garden of multifarious climates--9,366,000 square miles, from Panama to Greenland, to be exact--and the United Kingdom (94,217 square miles) is not. (The authoritative ``Sunset Western Garden Book,'' after all, delineates ``the West's 24 Climate Zones'' and dispenses altogether with the USDA zonal assignations--which put ``the Games rain forest into a zone with parts of the Sonoran Desert''--as sometimes absurd.) In fact, many of the ``hundred best plants for planting in North America,'' heralded by Sisco, are Z-7-8-9-10 (Dara odora, Trost officinale, Fuchsia `Arias,' Hebe pinguifolia) and can only be garden-grown in the few maritime parts of this country with benign climes comparable to Great Britain's. Not one of ``The Top 100 Garden Plants'' in the book ``first published in Great Britain in 1994'' has been ousted in favor of an adaptation that could survive outside a greenhouse in these parts. Nor does even one of the splendid trees and shrubs natural to desert gardening--palo verdes, acacias, mesquites, agaves, cacti--make ``The Top 100,'' even though desert conditions exist in parts of 17 states and Mexico. Surely someone at the Royal Horticultural Society must know that one Great British size cannot fit all? Beyond climate there is ``The Ultimate Book's'' condescension to organic gardening, about which Ms. Conroy writes dismissively: ``A truly organic garden is admirable, time-consuming, and not entirely realistic.'' What's realistic, apparently, are some four dozen brand-name poisons she mentions repeatedly: ``There comes a time when spraying with chemicals may be necessary.'' Why not ``use systemic weedkillers while perennial weeds are growing strongly ... but take care to avoid spraying ornamental plants.'' (She says nothing about spraying your ornamental self.) She even challenges, ``If, despite what I have written, you do not believe that chemical weedkillers are justified ... you will have to consider other options'' (i.e., lesser, short-of-total-wipeout options). She then invites gardeners down the paraquat path, volunteering, ``Paths may be tackled with a contact herbicide such as paraquat.'' Paraquat remains at the top of the EPA's ``Highly Toxic'' Class I ``Restricted Use'' list for good reason. This suspected mutagen, teratogen, neurotoxin is easily inhaled or absorbed through the skin--the smaller the particle, the more toxic--and causes a range of chronic maladies: loss of fingernails; liver, kidney, pancreas, adrenal, nerve, brain, heart, muscle and eye damage. Severe paraquat poisoning from as little as 1 teaspoon cannot be treated. At least 10 countries have banned paraquat. (Ms. Conroy does not warn of the effects of such favored weedkillers on gardenfolk, but writes only ``watch out for precious plants nearby, as bleak indeed can be the fatal results of a herbicide run amok.'') ``Use diazinon when planting'' cabbages, onion sets, potato seed beds, transplanting vegetable seedlings,'' Ms. Conroy advises about this close relative of World War II nerve gases. Does the author not know that the organo-phosphate biocide diazinon (a fetotoxin, immunotoxin, suspected mutagen and neurotoxin) is banned from use on golf courses and turf farms in the U.S.? Organic Gardening magazine, which has been an American publishing success for more than half a century, once answered a question about ``safe herbicides'' this way: ``The only two herbicides we can recommend are cultivation and mulching.'' The RHS and its ``adapters'' might have bothered to find out that organic gardening continues to gain adherents in North America (though pioneered by an Englishman) because Americans are choosing not to turn their gardens into toxic Arcadias. But this is cheap and dirty publishing. Though many Americans, myself among them, cultivate moss, Ms. Conroy repeatedly suggests a ``specific mosskiller ... green vitriol.'' The monumental brass of the RHS in foisting this thoroughly British garden book on an assumed naive American public arouses my own green vitriol. I find the Royal Horticultural Society, ``the most trusted and highly respected gardening organization in the world'' (according to ``The Ultimate's'' back cover), guilty ``in association'' of pulling the ultimate garden-book fraud for North America, 2011. Alas, this is not the first time the RHS has attempted to sneak a full-blooded British garden book into the American market without so much as a green card. (See Hardness Map)
