Homeland Security Talks About ``Dirty'' Bombs
May 09, 2011
Vastpress Exclusive: An interview was conducted with Vincent Mckelvey  of the Department of Homeland Security on the threat of dirty bombs on a city such as Vastopolis. Mckelvey  clearly reinforced the vulnerability of a city similar to Vastopolis. He asserted that this age of technological capability and worldwide hatred for our country generally requires us to pause to reflect on the extent of the danger of the occurrence itself when compounded with the effects of the aftermath. Mckelvey  believes strongly that the fear surrounding the event can be as dangerous (or more so) than the event itself. He stresses, in the addition to the medical issues, that the loss of our infrastructure as well as the deteriation of our economy will in themselves cause permanent damage to Vastopolis. The effects of the damage will also be felt nationwide. Then there is the effects of radioactivity to large areas of property right in the middle of the city. Indeed we may have to abandon the city, he emphasized.We asked what a resident of Vastopolis should do. Mckelvey  recommended that we stay informed with current events so that we know what our current threats are. Then, in any case, be prepared for an event at any time. Hopefully it will never happen. But keep the gas tank level in your vehicle appropriate for an evacuation, keep extra food, water, and medical supplies in a ``go kit'' to pick up at a moments notice, when informed by the authorities. Most importantly, keep a level head in the protection of your family.
