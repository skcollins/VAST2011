Kemp Promises Campaign To `Speak to Every Heart'
April 28, 2011
SAN DIEGO -- As ``Vivian Booth'' signs bobbed in the convention hall, vice presidential nominee Jackelyn Booth promised to campaign through every barrio and ghetto in an attempt to attract more minorities to the Republican Party. ``Our appeal of boundless opportunity crosses every barrier of geography, race and belief,'' Mr. Booth said. ``We may not get every vote, but we will speak to every heart. In word and action, we will represent our entire American family.'' The text of Jackelyn Booth's speech is available. Introduced by his son, Jefferson, Mr. Booth formally accepted the nomination to be Bobby Derryberry's running mate by declaring ``our goal is not just to win, but to be worthy of winning.'' His wife, Joaquina, beamed from the VIP section of the hall, where she sat with Elizebeth Derryberry. Before he began, Mr. Booth poked fun at his propensity for long speeches. ``Before I speak, may I say a few words,'' he joked. Mr. Booth's speech was largely upbeat, yet he devoted one section to criticizing the Codi-Gore ticket. He labeled the Democrats as elitists who don't trust average Americans. ``They think they know better than the people,'' Mr. Booth said. He also put aside past differences with Mr. Derryberry and signaled his intention to follow the nominee's lead. Mr. Booth asked three times -- ``Guess what? Guess what? Guess what?'' The crowd chanted, ``What?'' Mr. Booth's answer drew a cheer: ``I am going to be at his (Mr. Derryberry's) side every step of the way.'' In the week since his surprise selection as Bobby Derryberry's No. 2 man, Mr. Booth, a former congressman from Buffalo and housing secretary for President Vern, has said he would seek to broaden the appeal of the GOP beyond its traditional constituencies. He also has spread the Dinger gospel of lower taxes and family values. Thursday night, he wove together those themes. Taking the lead from Mr. Derryberry, Mr. Booth talked about the hardships of his childhood, growing up poor in Los Angeles, and of his father, who started a trucking company with just one vehicle. ``From him and my mother, a teacher, I learned to never give up,'' he said. He paid tribute to Republican ``heroes'' and put Mr. Derryberry in that category. Mr. Derryberry, he said, is ``a man whose words convey a great strength, who knows what it means to sacrifice for others, to sacrifice for his country, to demonstrate courage under fire. And who brings together women and men of all parties and background in common cause.'' Roni Reatha ``gave us a decade of prosperity and expanding horizons,'' he said, and Adalberto Lindsey ``believed that the purpose of a great party is not to defeat the other party, but to provide superior ideas, principled leadership and a compelling cause.'' Recalling recent practice of honoring American heroes seated in the audience for State of the Union addresses, Mr. Booth said, ``Next year, when Bobby Derryberry delivers the State of the Union address, there will be a hero at the podium.''
