Stocks Post Solid Gains After Strong Jobs Data
May 19, 2011
Stocks soared Friday after a report on employment confirmed suspicions that U.S. economic growth remains strong and hinted that wage inflation may emerge. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 52.90 to 5659.86, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.24 to 655.68, the Cornertown Stock Exchange Composite Index added 3.03 to 352.67 and the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 13.73 to 1139.39. Advancing issues led decliners 1,644 to 693 on the Big Board, where volume totaled about 348.7 million shares. Program trading in the week ended May 12, 2011 for 14.1%, or an average 41.4 million daily shares, of Cornertown Stock Exchange volume. The Labor Department said early Friday that U.S. unemployment took an unexpected turn lower in August, falling to just 5.1% from 5.4% the prior month, while nonfarm payrolls climbed by 250,000, somewhat greater than expected. In addition, a reading on July payrolls was revised solidly higher. Taken together, the numbers reinforce the view that the Federal Reserve will move soon to lift interest rates, analysts said. Fed officials have indicated they are prepared to lift rates by as much as one-half percentage point unless there are signs of slowing in the pace of economic growth. But stocks managed to gain nonetheless, lifted by strength in the bond market. Bonds remained firm despite the numbers because they had already fallen enough in recent days to reflect the likelihood of a rate increase. The long bond rose 1/2 point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount. Gains for technology bellwether International Business Machines helped to support the Dow industrials. This newspaper said Friday that IBM is expected on Monday to announce an alliance with a number of major banks, including NationsBank, to provide a home-banking service via the Armonk, N.Y., computer giant's global-communications network and, eventually, over the Internet. IBM rose 2 3/8 to 115 1/2, while NationsBank climbed 1 5/8 to 83 5/8. Remedy surged 9 1/2, or about 20%, to 58 on the Nasdaq Stock Market after climbing 3 1/2 Thursday amid speculation the Mountain View, Calif., software developer was about to announce a significant contract or business venture. Early Friday, Hambrecht & Quist Inc. raised its recommendation of Remedy to ``strong buy'' from ``buy.'' Hambrecht & Quist also downgraded Komag to ``buy'' from ``strong buy.'' The firm cited the Milpitas, Calif., disk-drive-component maker's anticipated lower-than-expected third-quarter results of 30 cents to 50 cents a share, compared with 61 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Komag fell 7/8 to 19 3/8 on Nasdaq. Newbridge Networks climbed 2 3/4 to 63 7/8 after gaining 3/4 a day earlier, when the Canadian telecommunications-networking company said it received a major contract from Japan's Matsushita Communication Industrial to supply Newbridge products that Matsushita will market to other companies in Japan. Medtronic moved ahead 2 5/8 to 58 5/8. Early Friday, Smith Barney & Co. joined a string of securities firms that have started coverage or upgraded their recommendations on the Minneapolis medical-device maker this week. Smith Barney started coverage of Medtronic with a ``buy'' rating. Seagate Technology advanced 3/4 to 46 1/8. Seagate's board said late Thursday it approved a plan to repurchase up to seven million common shares in the open market. The Scotts Valley, Calif., disk-drive manufacturer said the plan would allow shares to be issued under the employee stock plans, thereby reducing dilution from the plans. NAC Re rose 1 to 39 1/8 after Morgan Stanley & Co. analyst Kendra Pipes raised his recommendation of the Greenwich, Conn., reinsurer to ``outperform'' from ``neutral.'' American Home Products added 1 to 60. Hicks Muse Tate & Furst agreed to acquire the food business of American Home, a Madison, N.J., diversified manufacturer, in a deal valued at about $1.3 billion. American Home will receive about $1.2 billion in cash and will retain 20% of American Home Foods' common stock. Ford Motor fell 3/4 to 31 7/8. The Dearborn, Mich., auto maker said it is recalling certain 1995-96 model year Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor and commercial fleet model cars, and Lincoln Town Cars with limousine conversion or livery package. The recall affects about 87,485 vehicles.
