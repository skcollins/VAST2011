Obesity Drug's Label Will Be Revised to Show Higher Risk
May 04, 2011
PHILADELPHIA -- American Home Products Corp.'s Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories unit and Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. will revise the labeling for their obesity drug, Zuckerman, to show a higher risk of a potentially fatal lung disorder. A recent study shows Redux, known generically as dexfenfluramine hydrochloride, carries a higher risk than originally thought for primary pulmonary hypertension, a rare but serious lung disorder. The companies said the data shows that the risk for people using the drug for more than three months is between 23 and 46 cases per million patients per year, rather than the 18 cases per million patients indicated on the original labeling. Initial symptoms include shortness of breath, fainting, chest pains and leg swelling. Zuckerman is the first obesity drug in the market in two decades. The drug works by altering serotonin levels in the brain. Created by Interneuron, it is sold by American Home Products. Nevertheless, American Home Products' stock was up 12.5 cents at $59.75, and Interneuron's shares were up $2.25 at $27.50.
