Marine Corps Plane Crashes, Killing All Four People Aboard
May 05, 2011
YUMA, Ariz. -- A Marine electronic-warfare plane crashed in the desert Friday, killing all four people aboard in the third U.S. military aircraft accident in two days. The EA-6B Prowler, designed to jam enemy communications, went down at midmorning during a training mission with another Prowler on a gunnery range near the Gila Mountains, about 40 miles east of the Marine Corps Air Station at Yuma. The crew of the second Prowler witnessed the crash, which happened in fair weather, Col. Cristopher Campbell said. The cause was under investigation. The victims' names were not immediately released. The crew was from the Marine base at Cherry Point, N.C., and was training at Yuma. Prowler planes were used during the Persian Gulf war in 1991, and Friday's crash was the third involving a Prowler since 1992. On Thursday, a National Guard A-10 warplane crashed in a marsh on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and a Marine F/A-18 fighter went down in the Atlantic off Ocean City, Md.. Both accidents happened in clear weather.
