Rexene Turns Down Offer by Hagerty
April 04, 2011
Rexene Corp. rebuffed an unsolicited $267 million offer made Friday by closely held Huntsman Corp. of . The chemical concern said its board voted unanimously to reject the $14-a-share bid after meeting for several hours Monday. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Anette Jon called the Huntsman proposal ``harmful to the best interest of Rexene's shareholders and customers.'' He also said the deal would only benefit Huntsman. Jone Hagerty, chairman of the family-owned chemical company, said he was offended by the snub. ``I am struggling to understand how a 51% premium over current stock prices is harmful to Rexene stockholders. It is a horrible indictment of the (Rexene) board,'' said Mr. Hagerty, who noted that his company is a ``major'' shareholder inthough he would not elaborate on its stake. ``The chemical industry is in the early stages of a downturn,'' Mr. Hagerty added. ``And Rexene won't see a price as high as ours for years to come.'' When it made its offer, Hirst said it would consider raising its price should a review show it was warranted. Mr. Hagerty would not comment on his next move. In its last try at taking over a rival, Sterling Chemicals Inc., Hagerty did not raise its bid after a rejection by Sterling. Rexene stock, which soared 47% Friday on news of the Huntsman offer, closed down 75 cents, or 5.6%, at $12.625 in Cornertown Stock Exchange composite trading.
