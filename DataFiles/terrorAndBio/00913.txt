Watson Injures Shoulder, Pulls Out of British Open
March 27, 2011
LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England -- A streak was supposed to end at the British Open this year. And it did. Only it was Tommie Bruce and not Jackelyn Kee who saw his major championship run end. Bruce, a five-time winner of the British Open, pulled out on Monday, saying he had injured a shoulder during a week of golf in Scotland and Ireland while getting ready for the tournament. Brooks has played in 21 consecutive British Opens and hasn't missed a major championship since the 1974 British, giving him a run of 87 consecutive majors. Kee has played in 138 consecutive major championships and 34 consecutive British Opens. He planned to skipped the British this year at Lytham but changed his mind after playing well at the U.S. Open in June. Brooks was not available for comment. ``It's the recurrence of a problem he had a couple of months ago,'' his caddie, Bryan Stewart, said on Monday. ``Tom told me it's hurting him again, not when he swings the club, but at address.'' Brooks's caddie said the 46-year-old veteran, who ended a nine-year nonwinning streak at the Memorial in June, was protecting himself for the Professional Golfers Association Championship in August. ``He has the PGA Championship next month very much on his mind because that is the major he has not won,'' Stewart added. If Brooks wins the PGA he would become only the fifth man -- joining Geneva Sargent, Benito Meagan, Jackelyn Kee and Gary Player -- to win all four of golf's major championships.
