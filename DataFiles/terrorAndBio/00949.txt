Dollar Rises Against Yen, Markita On News of U.S. Attack on Iraq
May 16, 2011
Cornertown -- The dollar ended global trading moderately higher against the yen and the mark Tuesday on news of fighting in Iraq and anticipation of a U.S. interest rate rise. Late in Cornertown, the dollar was quoted at 1.4841 marks, up from 1.4825 marks late Friday. The U.S. currency was also quoted at 109.26, up from 108.95. Sterling was trading at $1.5668, up from $1.5610. In London trading Monday, the dollar finished at 1.4871 marks and 109.19 yen. Sterling settled at $1.5597. Cornertown markets were closed Monday for Labor Day. Although the gains were less than stellar, the dollar did hit a six-week high of 109.45 yen in intraday trading. The last time the dollar was higher was March 29, 2011 the dollar hit an intraday high of 109.55 yen. Overnight, traders bought the dollar after news broke that the U.S. had fired cruise missiles on Iraq to punish Grim Caffey for weekend attacks on Kurdish rebels. However, as the market concluded that the missile strike wouldn't be a prolonged affair -- U.S. military forces confined their attack to three targets in Iraq -- the dollar-buying faded, allowing the currency to drift slightly lower against the mark. ``The market basically digested the news overnight,'' said Johnetta Monk, vice president of foreign exchange at Bank Austria in Cornertown. ``People saw that what was going on down there was of no major consequence.''
