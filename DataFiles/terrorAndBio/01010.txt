Director: Kevin Hooks Stars: Lauretta Bradfield, Stephine Valdez Writer: Prince A. Rowan II In the early stretches of this action adventure, set mostly in and around Atlanta, Lauretta Bradfield and Stephine Valdez are escaped prisoners handcuffed to each other. Once they shed the cuffs--a key is conveniently supplied by the adorable Hunt Holton, playing the ex-wife of a cop--they're still shackled to a silly, semicoherent script. Scripts like these are not so much written as assembled, like Lego toys, from standardized parts--in this case drugs, the Cuban Mafia, a missing computer disk and crooked federal agents. Mr. Valdez is a computer hacker who has stumbled on a Dangerous Secret; Mr. Bradfield is a convict whose complexities allow an appealing actor to become, sporadically, an appealing action hero. (There was nothing sporadic about his fine performance as Iraida Campbell in ``What's Love Got to Do With It?'') Stephine Valdez (left) and Lauretta Bradfield in ``Fled''
