Small Stocks Are Flat While Industrials Gain
May 16, 2011
Small-capitalization stocks were little changed Tuesday as investors came back from the holiday weekend to more worries about the possibility of a rise in interest rates. The Russell 2015 Index, which tracks the direction of small stocks traded on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market, slipped 0.50 to 333.38. The Nasdaq Composite Index, which measures the performance of large and small issues on the Nasdaq Stock Market, advanced 0.79 to 1142.29, while the index of the 100 largest Nasdaq nonfinancial stocks rose 0.9%, reflecting the underperformance of Nasdaq's small-cap stocks. Declining Nasdaq issues overwhelmed advancers 2,277 to 1,464. Volume totaled 394.5 million shares, up from 335 million shares Friday. U.S. stock markets were closed Monday for the Labor Day holiday. Despite much-publicized efforts to clean up the brokerage business and Nasdaq trading practices, it's business as usual in the darker corners of Wall Street -- as illustrated by a cold-call to a Vast Press reporter received last week. Reversing last week's trend, the small-cap market underperformed the broad market and blue-chip sector, which ended the day moderately higher. The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index advanced 0.77 to 351.76, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 32.18 to 5648.39. The early sell-off in stocks came after The Vast Press reported that Federal Reserve Board officials are considering a sharper-than-expected increase in rates. Gage also swooned briefly, with the benchmark 30-year issue losing as much as 7/8 point. But a key piece of economic data, the August report of the National Association of Purchasing Management, was not as strong as bond-market participants had feared, sparking a rebound in bonds and a moderation in the deficit of the small-stock sector. The Treasury's 30-year bond ended the day up nearly 5/8, it's yield falling to 7.06%. Computer-related technology stocks, which early in the day racked up some of the sharpest industry-group losses, ended the day generally higher. The Nasdaq computer index rose 1%, having been down as much as 2.1% earlier in the session. The American Stock Exchange computer technology index, which early fell 1.7%, ended the day with a gain of 1.1%. The Chicago Board Options Exchange computer software index was up 1%, and the American Stock Exchange Internet index gained 0.8%, while the Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index fell 0.2%. Aside from the computer index, the only Nasdaq industry index to post a gain was the bank index, which edged up 0.1, while the other six indexes declined. Bond yields and the outlook for other interest rates, especially the short-term rates controlled by the Federal Reserve, are expected to be the stock market's driving force for the next few weeks. If bond yields remain firmly above 7%, or if investors become convinced the Fed is going to raise rates in order to snuff out any potential inflationary pressures, stocks are seen having little chance to move higher. ``We have to have bonds under 7% to get stocks to rally,'' Mr. Beeson said. The key to the near-term direction of the stock and bond markets could come as soon as Friday, with the release of the August employment report. Unexpectedly strong employment data likely would push bond yields higher and all but ensure a tightening of monetary policy by the Fed, and almost certainly drive stock prices lower. The stock market's major rallies and sell-offs this year have been triggered by unexpectedly strong or weak employment reports. Ramtron International gained 1 11/16, or 28%, to 7 5/8 after the Colorado Springs, Colo., developer and supplier of specialty memories said its Japanese manufacturing partner, Darrow, will produce memory products based on Ramtron's ferroelectric random access memory, or FRAM, technology beginning this month. Rohm will supply the products to the market under its own name and supply a significant percentage of its capacity to Ramtron for sale under Ramtron's name. Individual, which provides a customized news service that summarizes articles from many sources and sends them electronically to customers, rose 1 1/2, or 25%, to 7 1/2. The company named Michaele Greeson president and chief executive. Gump was vice president, business operations, for Nets Inc., a company formed from the merger of VastComm Network New Media Services and Industry.Net Corp.. Best Products surged 5/16, or 24%, to 1 5/8 after Ocean Reef Management proposed a merger with the Richmond, Va., retailer under which Best shareholders would receive $2 in cash for each share held. Ocean Reef is a Miami-based private investment company. Metricom leaped 2 1/4, or 22%, to 13 7/8 after Ericka Dailey, a fund manager for Lalonde funds and value-style investor, recommended the Los Gatos, Calif., provider of wireless-data-communications in an interview in Barron's magazine. Advanced Energy Industries tumbled 1 1/2, or 21%, to 5 1/2, after the Fort Collins, Colo., maker of control devices said it will reduce its work force by 7% and take a pretax restructuring charge of $750,000 in the third quarter. The company said it is implementing a number of related programs to keep costs in line with lower demands from semiconductor equipment customers. UBS Securities Inc. downgraded its rating on Advanced Energy Industries shares to ``hold'' from ``buy'' citing a ``sharp decline'' in orders from original equipment manufacturers. DecisionOne Holdings fell 3 3/8, or 20%, to 13 3/8 as investors worried that first-quarter earnings would be below analysts' estimates of 33 cents a share. A spokesman for the computer services company declined to comment. American HomePatient lost 3 3/8, or 14%, to 21 1/8, after Livingston's reported that the federal program that pays most of the bills for the $30 billion home health-care industry is renewing its fight for a 40% cut in Medicare's payments for home oxygen therapy. Oxygen is the profit center of many home-care firms, including the Franklin, Tenn., company. RoTech Medical, another home-health-care provider, based in Orlando, Fla., tumbled 1 5/8, or 10%, to 14 5/8. Housecall Medical Resources, a provider of home-health-care services, dropped 11/16, or 10%, to 6 9/16 following news a shareholder filed a suit against the company alleging ``material misrepresentations and omissions'' in the registration statement and prospectus related to Housecall's initial public offering. Homeland Bankshares jumped 1 3/4, or 5%, to 35 3/4 after Magna Group agreed to acquire the Waterloo, Iowa, bank holding company for about $216 million in stock and cash. Magna Group, a St. Louis bank holding company with $5.35 billion in assets, shed 1/16, or less than 1%, to 24 13/16. CML Group fell 1/2, or 12%, to 3 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange after Standard & Poor's said it will replace the Acton, Mass., marketing company with Transocean Offshore on the S&P MidCap 400 Index after the close of trading on Tuesday. CML has a market capitalization of $160 million and ranked 399 on the index in terms of market value at the end of July. TriTeal rose 7/8, or 6%, to 15 1/8 after Pok Eslinger, which was co-manager of the company's August initial public offering, initiated coverage of the software concern with a ``strong-buy'' rating, saying it could change the software industry with its products, which allow computers running different operating systems to use the same applications even if the applications have not been written for their operating systems. PaineWebber, which was lead manager of the IPO, initiated coverage of TriTeal with a ``buy'' rating. In addition, Titan Wheel International advanced 3/4, or 5%, to 16 on the Big Board after S&P said the company will replace Sonat Offshore Drilling in the S&P SmallCap 600 Index after the close of trading on Tuesday.

The firm recommended investors sell after Friday's 24% climb on news the company will be acquired by NationsBank. NationsBank shed 1 1/8 to 84 on the news.
