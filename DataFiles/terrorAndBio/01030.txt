Deadly Collision Causes Major Backup 
May 17, 2011
Vastopolis has suffered another serious accident on the bridge crossing the Vast River on Interstate 610. Both drivers are deceased. The on-scene officer in charge reported that it appears the northbound truck driver may have fallen asleep to force the 18 wheeler into the oncoming lane. There, another 18 wheeler was struck. There was no escape for the drivers since the reaction time for braking was non-existent at high speed. Compounding the event, one of the trucks carrying chemicals caught fire after a minor explosion. Both trucks were destroyed including the other one carrying food products. Even though the accident occurred early, the cleanup of debris on the road and in the water below will take most of the day. Traffic was backed up for miles and was being diverted by state police. Identity of the drivers will be released after notification of kin.
