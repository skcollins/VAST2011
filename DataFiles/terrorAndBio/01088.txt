Entended Training for ``Dirty Bombs'' Initiated
April 10, 2011
Police Commissioner Jacob Lucio announced that Vastopolis would conduct dirty bomb training exercises in June. These exercises would include not just the police department, but also every emergency service. The exercises would be carried out so that if such an event occurs, the public can feel just a bit safer knowing emergency management teams are ready for action. Lucio said that in June some roads may be blocked off for the training, but detours will always be put up for people to find their way around. Lucio believes that these exercises will be for the greater good of the public. The Police Commissioner said these exercises have become necessary in modern times. He stated that years ago there wasn't much to worry about with this kind of stuff, but with terrorist groups nowadays everyone needs to be prepared. Lucio said that schools would go through drills as well so the children would be ready, as the schools can be considered targets for terrorist groups. Police Commissioner Lucio assured the public today that these drills should cause very little interruption to everyone's daily lives.
