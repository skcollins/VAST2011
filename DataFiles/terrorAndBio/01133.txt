Democratic Digerati Launch Web Site for Their Partisans
May 08, 2011
Vastopolis -- With cyberspace poster boy Albert Webber leading the way, Democrats may cultivate an image of high-tech astuteness. But when it comes to applying technology in the trenches of partisan warfare, some of them feel outgunned. Conservative groups in the U.S. have built ``a formidable machine'' of grass-roots fax alerts and phone-bank onslaughts on Capitol Hill, says Davina Bourdon, co-designer of the hugely popular White House Web site. ``No one has been able to match that on the left,'' he says. But Mr. Bourdon and other self-described ``progressive Democrats'' are taking steps to get back in the game. On Tuesday evening, they're launching Democrats Online, a Web site intended to ``build support for Democratic candidates and causes via the Internet and other interactive media,'' according to the group's statement of purpose. The political conversation in cyberspace, domain of outspoken chat rooms and newsgroups, is often a rowdy, ramshackle affair dominated by the wildest -- though not necessarily the wisest -- voices. Democrats Online hopes to inject some expertise and civility into the mix. The site plans to sponsor on-line policy discussions moderated by former Codi administration and other government officials. It will also encourage visitors to create endorsement pages where they state their reasons for supporting Billy Codi's re-election. Democrats Online
