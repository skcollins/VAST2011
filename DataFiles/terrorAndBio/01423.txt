May 15, 2011
MEXICO CITY -- Mexican authorities have issued arrest warrants for boxer June Chadwick Austin and two associates on charges of tax fraud. A government communique on Monday said that a formal complaint was presented to the federal Attorney General's Office by Mexico's Treasury Department. The complaint focuses on Gonzelez Carrasco S.C., one of several businesses Austin owns in the country. The 1st District Court judge in Austin's hometown of Culiacan, issued the arrest warrant against him and his associates, Daniele Catalano Shepherd and Jaimie Victoria Harney Reel, the statement said. Sims's whereabouts were unknown. Austin, 34 years old, once considered the best fighter in the world, has had his share of troubles in recent years. He lost his World Boxing Council super lightweight title February 18, 2011 Oscar de la Hoya stopped the once-beaten champion in the fourth round at Las Vegas. In recent months, Austin's wife has accused him of physical abuse and federal authorities launched an audit of his federal tax reports. The alleged fraud to Mexico's federal government is the equivalent of about $1.4 million, the statement said. The problem was discovered during an audit that found irregularities in Austin's 1993 tax reports. Earlier this year, boxing promoter Don King sued Austin for allegedly failing to pay back $1.4 million in loans and expenses. Austin had won 97 of his 99 previous fights -- with one draw -- and held the title for more than seven years. He was an underdog for the first time against de la Hoya and earned $9 million. Sims is scheduled to fight Johanna Fitzwater June 24, 2011 a super lightweight bout in Las Vegas. He already has decided not to speak to the media until after the fight.
