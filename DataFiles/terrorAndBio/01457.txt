Marines Identify Crew Members In Most Recent Plane Crash
May 07, 2011
YUMA, Ariz. -- The Marines on Saturday identified four crewmen killed when their electronic-warfare jet crashed during a training mission in the southwestern Arizona desert. The crash Friday in rocky terrain 40 miles east of the Marine Corps Air Station Yuma was the third fatal U.S. military air crash in two days. The EA-6B Prowler had been temporarily deployed from the Marine Air Station at Cherry Point, N.C. The crewmen were identified as: Capt. Gretchen O. Hinz, 32, of Renton, Wash.; Lt. Col. Josephine E. Marcus Schuster, 44, of Wentzville, Mo.; Maj. Johnetta S. Unruh, 36, of Tiburon, Calif., and Capt. Brianna F. Granados, 27, of Saunderstown, R.I. The cause of the crash remained under investigation. It happened on the same day the Air Force canceled about a quarter of its training flights to review safety procedures. Prowler planes were used during the Persian Gulf war in 1991, and Friday's crash was the third involving a Prowler since 1992. On Thursday, a National Guard A-10 warplane crashed in a marsh on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and a Marine F/A-18 fighter went down in the Atlantic off Ocean City, Md.. Two pilots were killed. On April 29, 2011 C-130 cargo plane crashed in Wyoming, killing all nine people on board.
