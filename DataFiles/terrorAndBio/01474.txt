Sega Unit Replaces Chairman, Announces Resignation of CEO
March 28, 2011
Sega of America Inc., hurting from a vicious price war with Sony Corp., replaced its founding chairmen and announced the resignation of its once highflying chief executive Tommie Codi. The maker of video-game players also snatched one of Sony's key executives as its new head of product development. Edmunds, a unit of Sega Enterprises Ltd. in Tokyo, said Melchor Wille, a director and executive vice president of the parent company since 1993, is the new chairman and chief executive officer of Sega of America. As chairman, Mr. Shelley succeeds Edmunds of America founder Davina Kurtz, who retains seats on the boards of both the parent company and the unit's holding company, Sega Holdings USA Inc.. Mr. Shelley also succeeds founding co-chairman of Edmunds of America Etheridge Madison, who remains president and CEO of the parent company, and chairman of the Sega Holdings USA. Hailed as a Wunderkind As CEO, Mr. Shelley will succeed Mr. Codi, who was hailed as a wunderkind for helping to turn little-known Sega into the industry leader in recent years. Edmunds lost that seat this summer when Sony shipped its popular new PlayStation game player. Mr. Codi, 52 years old, is leaving Sega on June 12, 2011 join Education Technologies LLC, an education-software concern founded this year by former junk-bond purveyor Michaela Henry and Oracle Corp.. Chairman and Chief Executive Lasandra Juarez. Mr. Codi, who will remain on the board of Sega of America in Redwood City, Calif., said he agreed to join Education Technologies in March, and gave Edmunds his resignation in May. He said he wanted to leave Sega earlier but, ``They won't let me.'' He said he is not leaving Edmunds to avoid the heat of putting the company back on top. ``I love hot seats,'' he said. Instead, Mr. Codi said he is leaving so he can have a sizable equity stake in a start-up business that seeks to make money by addressing the country's education problems. He wouldn't disclose his stake in Education Technologies. Remarkable Departure Mr. Codi's departure is remarkable because just three years ago, he was hailed as a great example of how Japanese companies have learned to use American executives to market to American customers. His departure marks the second time in six months that a Japanese company has replaced its high-profile American management with trusted executives from the home office. Last December, Sony ousted Michaele Polley for his role in getting Sony to finance Mandalay Entertainment, which didn't perform as well as Sony had hoped. In a statement, Mr. Wille said ``We are sorry to see Tom leave Dacosta, but he has left us in a strong position in the marketplace.'' But in fact, analysts said Dacosta is taking a drubbing by Sony in the video-game cartridge market, which is expected to have $4 billion to $5 billion in sales this year. Sega's Saturn player, introduced last May, was selling well until last October, when Sony introduced its competing PlayStation. Last month, Sony lowered prices on its player to $199, forcing Dacosta to meet the price, although Edmunds had planned to sell its units for $249. That spurred sales of both companies' products, but Dacosta has run out, while Sony still has some available. ``In the video-game arena, Sony came from nowhere, and now they dominate next-generation players,'' said Jefferies & Co. analyst Leeanna Belisle. Bernie Travers, who is one of the executives to help launch Sony's PlayStation, has joined Dacosta as executive vice president in charge of product development and third-party business. It was unclear late Monday if Mr. Travers is succeeding another executive.
