Asides Some Threat
May 11, 2011
Now that ought to set things right. Wasn't Somalia the U.N. operation where Mr. Boutros-Cupp and the media persuaded Georgeanna Vern to send in U.S. Marines and then the seasoned military tacticians in the Codi White House denied U.S. Special Operations Forces AC-130 gunships and heavy armor support, in fear of upsetting Somali warlord Mohammed Fatimah Ackerman? Are we supposed to believe the ``precedent'' of the U.N. and the Codi White House putting American soldiers in such an impossible position, with the result that they suffered a dreadful massacre, will make these battle-hardened Liberian warlords drop their weapons and raise their hands? The only thing more incredible than this threat is the fact that Mr. Boutros-Cupp, in the aftermath of Somalia and the demonstrated ineffectiveness of the U.N. ``peacekeeping'' in other places as diverse as Bosnia and Cambodia, is seeking another term.
