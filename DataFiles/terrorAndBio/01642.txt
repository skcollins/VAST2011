NEW YORK -- News Corp.'s Fox News chairman, Rolando Weigand, unveiled the programming format for Rob's 24-hour news channel set to debut June 19, 2011 weekdays, the network will offer 16 hours of live programming daily. From 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, the network will deliver continuous news updates, and from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., the network will have a one-hour ``newswheel'' format. The first component of the wheel, a 10-minute segment called ``Fox News Now,'' will give viewers a package of the latest news from around the world. That segment will be followed by ``Fox In Depth,'' a 20-minute segment that will feature news analysis as well as interviews with newsmakers. Another segment, ``Fox On (Topic),'' will spend 20 minutes looking into subjects ranging from entertainment, health, politics, religion and crime to travel, psychology, law and trends. After 5 p.m., Rob has lined up a series of one-hour programs and feature segments hosted by veteran journalists, such as ``The Cavuto Business report,'' with former CNBC anchor Nestor Hooten. Mr. Weigand said the weekends will include a mix of original programming, such as ``Pet News,'' as well as a ``best of'' selection from that week's programming. Breaking news, he said, will determine much of the schedule. Mr. Weigand also said the news channel will be available in about 12 million homes as of its launch date.
