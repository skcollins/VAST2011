Radioactive Cargo on Ship in Port of Vastopolis
May 11, 2011
In a surprise move, Department of Homeland Security Agent Samuel Turman called Vastpress to report the interception of radioactive material on a large cargo ship. ``Our inspectors were on their toes when a random electronic search detected radioactive emissions,'' said Turman. Turman said that an external inspection of the container did not identify the intended destination. But the package will soon be opened for additional information. Neither the Captain nor the owner of the vessel had any knowledge of the cargo. Further they appeared enraged by the incident occurring on their ship. Homeland Security procedures required that all members of the crew be quarantined within the vessel until it was determined that their exposure was insignificant. They were then released. Turman wanted the public to know that his department is well aware of the potential shipment of dangerous cargo through our ports and that many measures are constantly employed to detect them.
