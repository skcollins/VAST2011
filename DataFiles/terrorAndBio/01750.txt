Major Robbery Attempt Fails
May 12, 2011
Downtown Vastopolis was spared a successful robbery attempt on a bank by several individuals armed with machine guns. Fortunately no one was hurt.  Luckily for law enforcement, the robbers were apprehended quickly. They were stopped by an auto accident on Interstate 905, near Villa and Westside. Again, no one was hurt. According to Police Commissioner Jacob Lucio, ``Were it not for their poor driving habits, the millions of dollars in bearer bonds would have been cashed and gone by this afternoon.''
