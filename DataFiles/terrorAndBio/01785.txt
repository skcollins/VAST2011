Robbery at Vast University
April 26, 2011
Vast University in Uptown reported a robbery today. Professor Edward Patino, a molcular biology professor, indicates that the large amount of equipment was stolen from his lab. Apparantly, the equipment was extremely expensive. To deal with the loss, Professor Patino has threatened to lay off several graduate students. He said if the University is not willing to fully replace all of the stolen equipment, he will be forced to make ``cutbacks''. Patino states that he has a responsibility to deliver results to his clients and he needs that equipment to finish his work. He told VastPress that the robbery is in-part the fault of the university. He said that if the maintenance department had done their job and changed the locks more often, this whole incident could have been avoided. The Vastopolis police are investigating.  Patino added that he was considering changing his focus to computer science so that he would only need a computer to do his research.
