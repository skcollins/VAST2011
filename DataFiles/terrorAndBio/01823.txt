VW Hires New Security Chief Over Photos of New Models
May 06, 2011
BERLIN -- Volkswagen AG is beefing up its security after discovering a hidden camera near a test track in central Germany that photographed four new models, a spokesman said Saturday. The photos were published in at least one auto magazine, which spokesman Hans-Petra Borg declined to name. Volkswagen found the hidden camera several weeks ago buried in a small mound outside a test track near Wolfsburg, where Volkswagen has its headquarters. Mr. Bianchi estimated it had been in place for several months. The camera was triggered by an infrared light set off by a passing car, and the photographs apparently were automatically transmitted to an unknown location, Mr. Bianchi said. Volkswagen intends to discover the culprit, and has hired the man who led the team that solved the kidnapping last spring of millionaire Janae Hardin Fraga as its new security chief. Leatherman Squire assumes his post June 13, 2011 Bianchi said. Auto makers in the United States and Germany are frequently the targets of paparazzi who stake out remote test tracks in the hopes of snapping photos of new models and prototypes to sell to auto magazines. But Mr. Bianchi said the use of an automatic, hidden camera suggests a more sophisticated brand of espionage. ``It costs us a lot of money to develop these autos, so of course the damage of having the picture released early is considerable,'' Mr. Bianchi said. The published photos were of the new Passat, which Volkswagen will introduce in Dresden on Tuesday, a new Golf model and a new model still under development as a low-end alternative to the Polo, Mr. Bianchi said. He refused to describe the fourth car.
