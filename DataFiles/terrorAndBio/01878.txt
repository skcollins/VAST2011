Dangerous Suspect Arrested at Local Plant
May 15, 2011
Officials from a food preparation plant in Vastopolis informed Vastpress that an individual was arrested for trespassing near the loading docks shortly after midnight.``Our dogs were the primary element alerting the on-duty security'' said Darwin Crocker, head of security. Crocker stated that all he knew was that the individual was dressed like a gang member. The investigating officer stated that the colors represented the Paramurderers of Chaos which required intervention by the FBI. We then contacted Special Agent Roy Wicker about the matter. Wicker would only say that the FBI is conducting ongoing investigations of radical groups, like this one, that seem to be springing up in this area.
