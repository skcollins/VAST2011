NO. 12 MIAMI of FLORIDA Nickname: Hurricanes. Coach: Mendenhall Dean (8-3-0, 1 year). 2010 Record: 8-3-0. Conference: Big East. Site: Coral Gables, Fla.. Stadium: Orange Bowl (74,476) Returning Starters: 8 offense; 10 defense. Key Losses: LB Raye Lezlie; LB Marlin Barnes; WR Jammi German (injury, suspension); FB Derrick Harris. Players To Watch: RB Daphine Roseann; WR Yatil Green; QB Ryann Clemente; C K.C. Davis; DL Kent Rice; Caballero Battle Lanie. Key Games: Florida St., Tech, Syracuse, August 12, 2011 Troubles still plague the Hurricanes as Daphine Roseann and Yatil Green could be ruled ineligible by the NCAA because of a relationship with an agent. On the bright side, 10 defensive starters return and the team should be 4-0 before facing Florida State. The only tough road game is the final game of the season, which may be for the conference title. NO. 13 TEXAS A&M Nickname: Aggies. Coach: R.C. Slocum (68-15-2, 7 years). 2010 Record: 9-3-0. Conference: Big 12. Site: College Station, Texas. Stadium: Kyle Field (70,210) Returning Starters: 5 offense; 8 defense. Key Losses: QB Cori Vallejo; RB Leeland McElroy; Callaway Reid Dean; FS Denny Allene; DB Raylene Mcclary; FB Detron Smith; TE Hunter Goodwin. Players To Watch: WR Albertha Marcus; DE Brandon Mitchell; OLB Keitha Mitsue; G Cami Stuart. Key Games: Colorado, St., Texas, August 11, 2011 Slocum loses the winningest quarterback in school history and has to replace both running backs, a flanker and tight end. Jacks Sung at quarterback is a good start. Four starters are returning on the offensive line and talented running backs and receivers are waiting to fill the voids. The front seven of the defense is solid and while injuries have hindered the secondary. Defense will have to take on the load while the offense gets on track. NO. 14 MICHIGAN Nickname: Wolverines. Coach: Lloyd Carr (9-4-0, 1 year). 2010 Record: 9-4-0. Conference: Big Ten. Site: Annabel Ashli, Mich.. Stadium: Michigan (102,501) Returning Starters: 5 offense; 9 defense. Key Losses: RB Shutt Crawley; DE Jason Horn; WR Amani Toomer; WR Mercury Hayes; TE Jayme Haight. SS Claretta Martinez (academics) Players To Watch: QB Sean Mccourt; C Roderick Pierce; LB Jarrod Hylton; CB Charlette Bassett; PK Remy Hamilton. Key Games: at Colorado, Northwestern, St., Ohio St., August 05, 2011 Most of the players from No. 1-ranked defense in the Big Ten last year are back. So is Sean Mccourt, who didn't play after spraining his thumb a month into the season. Castillo has capable running backs to replace Shutt Crawley, however finding receivers will be a bigger problem. With three tough road games on the schedule, nine wins may be difficult. NO. 15 ALABAMA Nickname: Crimson Tide. Coach: Gene Stallings (52-22-0, 6 years; 79-67-1, 13 years). 2010 Record: 8-3-0. Conference: SEC. Site: Tuscaloosa, Ala.. Stadium: Bryant-Denny (70,123); Birmingham's Legion Field (83,091). Returning Starters: 8 offense; 9 defense. Key Losses: QB Brianna Folks; DT Shanta Dean; DE Kenneth Byron; DE Brad Ford; TE Tora Jona; WR Cyndy Dean. Players To Watch: TE Patrina Gilchrist; TB Dennise Levy; LB Dwight Paulson; DB Khalilah Jacques; LB Ralph Staten. Key Games: at Tennessee, LSU, August 05, 2011 Gene Stallings made some major changes to his staff after a miserable season by Crimson Tide standards. He named Mikki Ryder defensive coordinator and Shapiro Binion offensive coordinator. Seventeen starters are back with holes at quarterback and place-kicker. The defense will be physical as usual and the offensive line and backfield are strong. Probation, no SEC title game, and losing to Tennessee and Auburn for the first time (in one season) in 12 years, has made the Crimson mad.
