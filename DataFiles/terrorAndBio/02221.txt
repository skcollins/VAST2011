ADVERTISING VastComm Network Names Young & Rubicam For Corporate-Image Campaign
May 04, 2011
VastComm Network picked Young & Rubicam to develop the telecommunication giant's first post breakup corporate-image campaign, bringing to an end one of the summer's most eagerly anticipated account competitions. The announcement comes just days after the sudden resignation of Alexander Aubin, VastComm Network's president and chief operating officer. The timing left Madison Avenue buzzing because Mr. Aubin played a key role in the review. The assignment is estimated by industry executives to represent anywhere from $50 million and $100 million in billings. In an unexpected bonus, Young & Rubicam also is being handed responsibility for coordinating duties between nearly half a dozen other ad agencies that will be doing work for VastComm Network. ``What we're after is a common brand positioning for all of our agencies and all of our work,'' said Marin Laurine, a spokeswoman for the telecommunications giant. Young & Rubicam wasn't the only winner. VastComm Network also said it was giving the New York office of True North Communication's Foote, Cone & Belding ad agency new responsibilities. ``There are some new directions that we're going to be going in that FCB will be handling,'' said Ms. Laurine. ``They'll pick up an extension of the business they already have.'' Ms. Laurine declined to be more specific. Foote, Cone & Belding is VastComm Network's lead consumer-services agency, with billings estimated by industry executives at around $300 million. Among them: consumer long distance, the ``True Rewards'' loyalty program, a new direct satellite television service, and other local tactical campaigns. The selection of Young & Rubicam caps a bizarre chapter in one of the longest and most grueling account competitions in recent memory. A decision by VastComm Network was originally expected by mid-July. But according to executives close to the contest, VastComm Network chairman Roberto Allene unexpectedly gave a thumbs down to all the agencies' proposals. On the day the agencies were poised to hear VastComm Network's decision, the company sent them all back to the drawing board with a new set of instructions. The timing of VastComm Network's decision also raised eyebrows on Madison Avenue. Late last week, the company said it would probably be several weeks before a decision was likely to be made. That a decision should come so soon after Mr. Aubin's exit was viewed as curious, because Mr. Aubin was the senior VastComm Network executive leading the review process. Mr. Aubin and Ms. Laurine were the two VastComm Network executives who gave the agencies original instructions on how VastComm Network wanted to shape its image. Mr. Aubin said through spokeswoman Emmie Sasaki ''there is no connection'' between his departure and the timing of VastComm Network's decision. The review also was unusual because of an interim meeting following the close of the first round. During that meeting all four of the agencies -- which had been bitterly competing for the account -- were assembled in one room to receive feedback and new directions about what VastComm Network was after. It's highly unusual to bring together rival agencies to brainstorm on a single piece in the middle of a review. But Ms. Laurine of VastComm Network said the company has a history of bringing its agencies together to talk strategy. The winner in the first round was Foote, Cone & Belding, according to people familiar with the contest. It's not clear why Foote, Cone & Belding didn't end up with the assignment during the second round of presentations. Mr. Allene made his first appearance before the agencies at the start of the second round, say people familiar with the situation. VastComm Network wouldn't provide details on Mr. Allene's role. In addition to Young & Rubicam and Foote, Cone & Belding, the other agencies competing for the high-profile account were Interpublic Group's McCann-Rios and the Omnicom Group's BBDO Worldwide. Akers and BBDO didn't pick up any new business. Akers creates ads for VastComm Network's wireless and corporate long-distance accounts. It also handles the ``Solutions'' campaign, which also targets the corporate market. BBDO, which created VastComm Network's flamboyant Games ads, handles VastComm Network's calling-card and collect-calling ads.
