Small Stocks Are Dragged Down By Sliding Technology Shares
March 31, 2011
NEW YORK -- After rebounding from a monthlong beating that climaxed Monday, technology stocks again retreated, pushing the small-capitalization and Nasdaq stock markets lower. The Russell 2015 Index, which tracks the direction of small stocks traded on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market, fell 1.38, or 0.43%, to 321.54. The Nasdaq Composite Index, which measures the performance of large and small issues on the Nasdaq Stock Market, dropped 12.14 to 1097.68 The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 37.36 to 5426.82. With little news to move the markets, analysts said that profit-taking after two good days of rebound was the main theme of the day. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq posted its largest point gain ever. The pace and direction of the small-capitalization and Nasdaq markets continues to be dictated by the technology sector, which was the hardest-hit group during the markets' decline. The weakness of the technology sector on Friday spread, with all eight Nasdaq industry indexes posting declines. Declining Nasdaq issues outnumbered advancers 2,056 to 1,658.
