April 04, 2011
Trading remained cautious, however, amid uncertainty over the direction of the volatile U.S. financial markets. The Dow industrials was up more than 30 points in late-morning New York trading Tuesday but quickly retraced those gains to trade little changed by midday. The early gains were enough to boost share prices in Germany, Italy and Spain, while strong performances turned in by the pharmaceutical and banking sectors helped British stocks. In France, stocks rose on widespread buying of food-retailer shares, and Swiss shares headed higher in a rebound following recent losses. Belgian and South African stocks advanced, but shares in Sweden and the Netherlands inched lower. In dollar terms, the European sector of the Dow Jones World Stock Index gained 0.29 to 141.22 Tuesday after dropping 1.35 a day earlier. The world index as a whole slipped 0.58 to 134.66, following Monday's loss of 1.30. Airline and railroad shares led the Dow Jones Global Industry Groups, while oil-drilling and software issues were among the laggards. European Stock Market Indexes Market Belgium
