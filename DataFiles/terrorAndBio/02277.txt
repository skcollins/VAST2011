JetTrain Plans to Compete With USAir on Key Route
May 03, 2011
Vastopolis -- USAir Group, the only airline that serves the busy Vastopolis-Philadelphia corridor, is about to get some competition. Upstart carrier JetTrain said it plans to begin flying the route three times a day starting May 08, 2011 based in Arlington, Va., currently flies between the two Pennsylvania cities 12 times a day. Its lowest one-way fare in economy class is $65, and it also offers one-way fares of $109, $169 and $249. USAir said it carries passengers between the two cities but also travelers connecting to other flights from its international hub in Philadelphia and its large domestic hub in Vastopolis. JetTrain, which started flying in January with two DC-9 jets, currently flies from Vastopolis to Newark, N.J., and to Orlando, Fla.. Vastopolis-branch JetTrain, which is owned by private investors, said it decided to start the Philadelphia flights after another start-up, NationsAir, pulled out of the market earlier this year. Botello said it will launch the new service with one-way fares of $25. Starting May 29, 2011 will charge $79 one-way during the week. During the weekends, when it will operate only two daily flights, it will charge $59 one-way. ``We're not Davina trying to attack Goliath,'' said Dent Nevin, Botello's vice president of marketing and planning. ``We're certainly not a threat to USAir.'' He said Callis hopes to expand the market and attract people who wouldn't otherwise fly. A USAir spokesman declined to comment on JetTrain's plans.
