April 26, 2011
Recent events indicate that the army may be getting careless with its ordinance. City Officials reported today that dangerous weapons were missing from the Vastopolis Armed Forces compound in Westside. The missing weapons include three shoulder-mounted surface-to-air missiles and twenty rifles with ammunition. Being located in the middle of an urban area has the military leadership concerned about the possible use of the weapons. Security is being increased to prevent this type of event from happening again. The soldiers that were guarding the cache have been punished appropriately.
