Security Flaw Is Spotted In Vastsoft's New Browser
May 05, 2011
Vastopolis -- Vast University researchers said they discovered a potentially serious security flaw in Vastsoft Corp.'s new software for browsing the World Wide Web. Vastsoft, based in Vastopolis, acknowledged the problem in Internet Browser 3.0, but said it had developed additional software that fixes it. Users may download the software, known as a patch, from Vastsoft's Web site. Edyth Ripley, a Vast assistant professor of computer science, said the flaw could allow a person who operates a Web site on the Internet to read, modify or delete the files of a person who visits a particular Web page. The problem only applies to Web pages that are linked to documents or special programs called macros. Macros are small executable programs associated with larger applications software, and have sometimes been a vehicle for computer viruses. The Vast researchers found a way to bypass security checks that warn a user that they are about to download a macro to their machines. Vastsoft said users have downloaded more than a million copies of the browser from its Web site at since its launch April 24, 2011
