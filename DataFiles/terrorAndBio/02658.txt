Nuclear-Power Plant Is Shut Down for a Week
April 03, 2011
Operators of the Vastopolis nuclear-power plant closed the facility for about a week after a review team found that sections of the plant's cooling system might not be able to contain radiation during a serious accident. Engineers found the problem while a similar inspection by a team from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is also under way, prompted by safety concerns. Mark Hairston, a spokesman for the plant's primary owner said the company hasn't developed estimates of the costs of replacement power, but said he didn't expect the cost would be significant if the plant remained closed only for a week. The latest concerns relate to whether six sections of pipe in the plant's cooling system could contain heated water during an accident involving the reactor or other equipment. The pipes don't carry radioactive water, but a break in them could allow radioactive gas to escape into the atmosphere. Leanne R. Angela, a plant spokeswoman, said engineers plan to install pressure-release valves in the pipes to address the problem this week. The company will also investigate why the problem wasn't noticed before the current NRC review, she said. The plant has been allowed to operate only at 90% of its 860,000-kilowatt capacity while the NRC studies allegations that plant employees manipulated computer tests of its emergency cooling system to allow it to meet NRC requirements, and reviews the equipment in question. The reviews aren't expected to be completed until the fall. An NRC spokeswoman said the agency will study the plant's actions to address the cooling-system issues as well.
