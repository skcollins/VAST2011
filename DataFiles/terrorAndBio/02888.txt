Small-Cap, Nasdaq Stocks Rise On Gains in Technology Group
April 26, 2011
Small-capitalization stocks advanced Wednesday as the technology sector regained most of Tuesday's losses. The Russell 2015 Index, which tracks the direction of small stocks traded on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market, rose 1.09 to 326.72. The Nasdaq Composite Index, which measures the performance of large and small issues on the Nasdaq Stock Market, gained 7.36 to 1133.51. The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index advanced 1.02 to 353.64, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 19.60 to 5666.88. Advancing Nasdaq issues outnumbered decliners, 2,067 to 1,690. Volume totaled 428.6 million shares, up from 405 million shares Tuesday. Trading volume was thin and relatively uninspired throughout the session as traders reacted to corporate earnings news and the drop in stock prices that was caused by Tuesday's decline. The Nasdaq computer industry index gained 3.75 to 422.59, while seven of the eight other industry indexes also registered gains. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index gained 2.65 to 169.00. Traders said they expect the market to remain rooted in this late summer malaise into September when two key economic reports will be released. Stock and bond buyers alike are waiting for the U.S. Labor Department's report on August employment, and the National Association of Purchasing Management's index that measures manufacturing. ``Those two reports will make it or break it for the stock market. Between now and then it's summer doldrums, I'm afraid,'' said Humberto Jona, First Albany Corp.'s chief investment strategist. In order for the market to re-energize, Jona said the two reports would have to confirm that the economy, particularly in August, continued to grow at a moderate pace with very low inflation. The Federal Reserve Board's policy-making committee meets May 02, 2011 traders and strategists agree that interest rates are not likely to be increased. `The market has no reason to do anything,'' said Michaele Langford, Oppenheimer & Co.'s market strategist. Many, if not all, mutual fund managers, are concerned with keeping enough cash on hand to cover redemptions, instead of keeping their portfolios fully invested and using excess cash to buy on market dips. ``The problem now is that money flows are unpredictable. Two or three months ago anything that you held in cash was a drag (on) performance,'' Mr. Langford said. ``The outlook is clouded. Those guys are building up cash.''
