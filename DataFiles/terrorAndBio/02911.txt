U.S. Trade Panel Clears Duties Against Printing-Press Industry
May 04, 2011
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. International Trade Commission took the final step needed for the U.S. to impose antidumping duties on German and Japanese manufacturers of printing presses. In a 5-0 vote, the ITC determined that the domestic printing-press industry had been damaged, or threatened with damage, because the German and Japanese machines were being sold in the U.S. at unfairly low prices. The Commerce Department already had set preliminary duties on the German and Japanese companies, after determining that the imported printing presses were being sold in the U.S. at below-market prices. Last summer, the ITC found that there was a ``reasonable indication'' that Rockwell International Corp., whose interests include printing presses, was harmed by below-market pricing. As a result of Wednesday's ITC determination, the Commerce Department will impose the following added margins on these imports: For Japanese companies, 62.96% on Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., 56.28% on Tokyo Kikai Seisakusho Ltd., and an average of 58.97% for other Japanese companies. For German companies, 30.8% for Man Roland Druckmaschinen AG, 46.4% for Koenig & Bauer/Albert AG, and 30.8% for other German companies.
