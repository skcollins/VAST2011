America Online to Launch Service for Local Markets
March 29, 2011
NEW YORK -- America Online Inc. is expected to launch Wednesday a new company to provide news and services catering to local markets via the Internet. The new company, dubbed Digital Cities Inc., is expected to require a $100 million investment and will target information to 88 local markets throughout the U.S., much like newspapers cater to smaller communities. Media company Tribune Co. is expected to take a 20% stake, or roughly $20 million, in Digital Cities, helping AOL launch local information services in Chicago, southern Florida and Hampton Roads, Va., where it currently distributes newspapers. The move follows some high-profile efforts to make on-line information more useful and engaging for consumers. Various companies including Vastsoft Corp. are working to provide news, local listings, school information and weather to make on-line services a part of everyday life. That has threatened newspapers, which are weary of losing their customers to on-line services that can offer information unconstrained by print space. The Digital Cities initiative was started last fall as an in-house effort of AOL. But Stevie Gould, chairman and chief executive of AOL, said a separate company could bring services more quickly to market. Unlike rival Vastsoft, Digital Cities could immediately have an audience in AOL's 6 million subscribers and move first to market, said Mr. Gould. Mr. Gould also has the advantage of long-time partner Tribune, which has owned a 5% stake in AOL for years and is a national company with local news-gathering affiliates. ``They provide the general expertise about building local affiliates and building partnerships in local markets,'' Mr. Gould said.
