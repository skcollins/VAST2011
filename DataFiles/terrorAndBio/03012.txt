Small-Cap Stocks Advance On Bond Market's Mild Gains
May 09, 2011
Small-capitalization stocks rose Tuesday on the bond market's mild advance and gains in the computer-related technology sector. The Russell 2015 Index, which tracks the direction of small stocks traded on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market, rose 2.23 to 333.75. The Nasdaq Composite Index, which measures the performance of large and small issues on the Nasdaq Stock Market, gained 9.81 to 1149.03. Advancing Nasdaq issues outnumbered decliners 2,165 to 1,666. Volume totaled 491.1 million shares, up from 422 million shares Monday. The small-cap market outperformed larger issues. The New York Stock Exchange advanced 1.26 to 357.15, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 17.38 to 5711.27. The bond market's mild advance Tuesday, after the yield on long-term bonds neared 7% over the past few days, was a welcome sign to the equities market. The 30-year bond rose about 3/8, pushing the bellwether's yield down to 6.96%. It was the bond's yield rise above 7% that triggered the stock market's severe correction in July. The small-capitalization and Nasdaq markets were driven by gains in the technology sector, which resumed its upward move following Monday's moderate retreat. Small-cap stocks in a wide array of industry groups saw moderate buying interest. ``The real story was chip stocks,'' said Sean Twilley, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd.. Many of the smaller semiconductor and chip-related stocks, ``are out of their downtrends,'' he said. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index rose 1%. ``A lot of people are thinking that the worst is over for these companies,'' Mr. Twilley said of the recently hard-hit industry group. ``The secondary chip makers are doing real well. These stocks should be bought on weakness.'' Among small-cap semiconductor and chip-related issues, C-Cube Microsystems rose 4 1/4, or 12%, to 39 1/4, and Sanmina Holdings advanced 1 11/16, or 5%, to 35 1/2. Oak Technology added 5/8, or 10%, to 7 1/8, and Advanced Semiconductor Materials gained 23/64, or 5%, to 7 1/8. Other technology-sector readings posted significant gains. The Nasdaq computer index rose 1.1%, and the American Stock Exchange computer technology index was up 0.5%. The Chicago Board of Options Exchange computer software index gained 0.7%, and the American Stock Exchange Internet index added 1.2%. The strength of the small-cap and Nasdaq markets today was not limited to the technology sector, with seven of the eight Nasdaq industry indexes posting gains. Many investors and analysts have been lulled into a state of complacency by the light levels of trading seen the past few weeks, especially when compared with the frenetic activity that characterized July, when the market was in the midst of its severe correction. But Nasdaq volume today almost hit the 500 million-share mark, a sign the summer doldrums are about to end.
