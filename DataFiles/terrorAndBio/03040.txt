CDC Publication on Bioterrorism
April 18, 2011
Residents of Vastopolis are feeling a bit more anxious today after the Center for Disease Control released a publication on the threats of bioterrorism. The publication focused on many of the more modern day threats due to advanced technology. According to Dr. Bryant Mcfarlane of the CDC, the nation needs to set a priority of preparing a response to acts of bioterrorism. But some experts are still uncertain of what tactics, targets or weapons could be used in such an attack, and are therefore unsure of how to prepare properly for them. The publication had a large focus on attacks to the food supply. The CDC believes that the food supply has the highest probability of being a bioterrorism target due to ease of dissemination. They say that targeting the food supply allows for widespread consumption by the populace that can be difficult to identify until it is too late.
