Bond Market Lifts Small Stocks, But Technology Shares Decline
April 28, 2011
Despite a decline in the technology sector, small-capitalization stocks advanced Friday as the bond market cheered a weak report on housing starts. The Russell 2015 Index, which tracks the direction of small stocks traded on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market, rose 1.23, or 0.38%, to 329.91. The Nasdaq Composite Index, which measures the performance of large and small issues on the Nasdaq Stock Market, fell 1.04 to 1133.65, while the index of the 100 largest Nasdaq non-financial stocks fell 0.71%, reflecting the underperformance of Nasdaq's largest issues. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 23.67 to 5689.45. Advancing Nasdaq issues outnumbered decliners 2,024 to 1,635. Overall volume totaled a very light 421 million shares, compared with 457 million shares on Thursday. For the week, the Russell 2015 was up 1.47, or 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 3.62, or 0.4%. Technology shares defied expectations Friday and held relatively firm in the wake of weak earnings from Hewlett-Packard. The nation's second-largest maker of personal computers posted net income of 40 cents a share, falling short of Wall Street's estimate of 48 cents. The computer-related technology sector advanced early, was mixed by midafternoon, and by the close pushed the Nasdaq Composite mildly lower. The Nasdaq Computer Index surrendered 3.89, or 0.92%, to 417.55. The Amex computer technology index dropped 1.3%. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index fell 1.1%, the Chicago Board Options Exchange computer software index declined 0.2% and the Amex Internet index tumbled 2%. ``The techs gave up a little ground,'' said Petrina Cleland, managing director of equity trading at Brean Murray Foster Securities. ``People were looking to take profits, and traders were looking to flatten out for the weekend.'' One positive influence for the stock market Friday was the action in bonds. The bond market rose on the Commerce Department's report that housing starts fell in July for the third straight month. The long bond gained 1/2 point to yield 6.76%. Trading activity continued to be extremely light, leading traders and analysts to caution against reading too much significance into the market's summer fluctuations. Light trading activity typically exaggerates price action, so Friday's losses in the technology sector, traders said, overstated any weakness within the group ``There's nothing much to be discerned from (Friday), other than people are sticking close to home,'' Mr. Cleland said. ``People who don't have to be in the market are waiting until the summer's over.'' Absent an unexpected market event, such as a tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve after next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, market professionals expect stocks to be confined to relatively narrow ranges until September. ``Liquidity has been sucked out of the market. There's no sense of urgency to jump into the market,'' Mr. Cleland added. ``It's another Friday in August. A lot of people are out and a lot of desks are half-staffed, and even at that, they're overstaffed.'' Overall, six of the eight Nasdaq industry indexes advanced, although none gained as much as a full percentage point, and only two -- the bank and financial indexes -- rose as much as 0.5%. Rattlesnake Holding rose 1 3/8, or 41%, to 4 3/4 after the Stamford, Conn., chain of theme restaurants acquired its first restaurant in Manhattan. The company said the restaurant is its eighth Rattlesnake Southwestern Grill in the New York area. Emulex fell 1 1/4 to 13 3/4. The Costa Mesa, Calif., designer of computer networks and network software posted a loss of nine cents a share for the fiscal fourth quarter ended March 12, 2011 with a profit of 17 cents a share in the year-ago period. Earnings fell short of Wall Street's estimate of a break-even quarter. The company also said it will lay off 9% of its workforce and take a consolidation charge of $1.3 million in its fiscal 2012 first quarter. Collagen jumped 2 1/2 to 20 after the Palo Alto, Calif., developer of breast implants posted financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter. For the quarter ended March 12, 2011 earned 70 cents a share, compared with 29 cents in the year-earlier quarter. Shares of Alliance Entertainment, a New York music distributor, slid 7/8 to 5 7/8 after the company agreed pay at least $45.2 million in stock for Red Ant Entertainment, a recently-formed music company whose principals include former MCA Music Entertainment Group Chairman Albert Stuck and an arm of investment bank Warrington Harty. Epic Design Technology tumbled 3 1/8 to 18 5/8 after Alex.Brown & Sons downgraded the Sunnyvale, Calif., developer of software tools to ``buy'' from ``strong buy.'' HighwayMaster Communications lost 1 1/4 to 11 1/4 after Smith Barney downgraded the Dallas provider of a wireless communications network for the long-haul trucking industry to ``neutral'' from ``venture.'' A source said a ``venture'' rating is assigned to stocks that are expected to have a higher return than ``buy''-rated stocks but which also carry a higher risk. RadiSys dropped 1 1/2 to 42 after J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. downgraded the Beaverton, Ore., computer manufacturer to ``market performer'' from ``buy.'' Netcom On-Line Communication Services gave up 2 13/16 to 18 13/16. The Internet-access service, based in San Jose, Calif., restated second-quarter earnings to reflect a lower valuation on an equity investment. The restated results include a charge of $1.2 million, or 10 cents a share, for a reduced valuation of Netcom's investment in McKinley Group, Sausalito, Calif.. Netcom in June 2010 paid $1.5 million for a McKinley stake. Consolidated Cigar, Ronda Flory's latest initial public offering, surged 5 3/8, or 23%, to 28 3/8, from its initial $23 a share. Culbro leaped 4 7/8 to 53 1/2. The cigar maker rose on the enthusiasm coming off the initial public offering Friday of competitor Consolidated Cigar. Analysts International climbed 7/8 to 36. The Minneapolis provider of software services reported net income of 46 cents a share for the fiscal fourth quarter ended March 12, 2011 exact same earnings as the quarter last year. In separate news, Analysts' board declared a 2-for-1 common stock split and increased the company's quarterly dividend. E\*Trade, the on-line electronic discount broker, advanced 3/4 on its initial public offering of $10.50 a share, to 11 1/4. Trimedyne leaped 15/16, or 22%, to 5 1/8. The Irvine, Calif., maker of lasers and other medical devices said the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office upheld the validity of all of the claims in its key laser patent. The patent covers higher powered, more versatile pulsed laser systems than those of competitors. In 2010, Laser Industries filed a petition with the PTO, asking that Leong's patent be re-examined. Applied Signal Technology jumped 5/8 to 5 1/4 after the digital-signal processing-equipment company from Sunnyvale, Calif., posted a third-quarter profit of 14 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of 17 cents.
