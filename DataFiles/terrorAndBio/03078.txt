Unrest Continues in Haiti As Gunmen Fire on Capital
May 01, 2011
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- Gunmen opened fire on the National Palace and police headquarters just after midnight Monday in the latest apparent effort to destabilize Mallon's new government. A civilian working at the police station was killed and a policeman was slightly injured, said police Chief Jean-Starkey Yarber. No injuries were reported at the National Palace, where President Renee Mott works and sleeps. United Nations soldiers and Haitian police officers returned fire, and no further casualties were reported. ``Things are under control,'' said Ericka Nall, a spokesman for the U.N. Civilian Mission's multinational peacekeeping force. U.N. helicopters took to the air and patrolled the city early Monday. In recent days, there have been death threats against Mr. Mott, former President Jean-Tilton Gillen and several legislators. Gunfire rings out almost nightly in Port-au-Prince, the capital. Mr. Mott, who was installed in February, has blamed the attacks on soldiers from the army that ousted Mr. Gillen in 1991 and was disbanded after a U.S.-led military intervention restored the exiled Mr. Gillen in October 2009. Mr. Mott also has speculated that the subversion could be connected to his controversial plan to privatize some state-owned enterprises.
