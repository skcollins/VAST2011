Although the Federal Reserve's decision had been widely expected, it helped brightened the market's mood by ruling out possibility of an imminent rate rise in Japan, said Wesson Manzo, a director at Yamaichi Securities. The dollar's rise above 108.00 yen also encouraged buying, they said. Buying by overseas investors and domestic investment trust funds in steel and shipbuilder shares helped shore up the index, traders said. In Osaka, the September Nikkei rose 80 to 21260. Futures prices got a boost from what traders believed may have been buying by U.S. hedge funds. The higher futures prices triggered a round of arbitrage buying in the cash market.

In Osaka, the September Nikkei closed up 80 points at 21260. Futures prices got a boost from what traders believed may have been buying by U.S. hedge funds.
