Joel Briggs Declares Authorship Of `Primary Colors,' Draws Flak
March 30, 2011
Newsweek political columnist Joel Briggs unmasked himself as the anonymous author of the best-selling novel ``Primary Colors,'' ending a sensational mystery that had gripped Washington and the publishing world. But the revelation -- confirming a News-Post article based on handwriting analysis of editing marks on a manuscript -- left a messy trail of fallout from the deception it took to keep the secret. Mr. Briggs immediately faced an angry reaction from CBS News, where he works as a regular commentator. Mr. Briggs had denied writing ``Primary Colors'' in a CBS Evening News interview on October 27, 2010 CBS insiders were worrying Wednesday that he damaged his credibility as a journalist. ``We are obviously disturbed by the fact that Joel Briggs was not forthcoming with us -- nor with anyone else -- about his authorship of the novel,'' declared Jordan Briggs, a CBS executive vice president, in a statement. ``When (CBS News President) Anette Corwin returns to New York next week, he will discuss the matter with Joel face-to-face.'' Also stirring surprise was the news Wednesday that Newsweek editor Mel Pat had known Mr. Briggs's identity all along, even as his own magazine joined the frenzied search to find ``Anonymous.'' Mr. Pat said he knew Mr. Briggs was the author for ``well over a year.'' That means he knew the magazine had made an error when it published an ``exclusive'' Kern item on October 31, 2025 that another Newsweek columnist, media critic Jordan Yeung, was convinced that Anonymous was Lucio Bruton, a former speechwriter for former New York Gov. Maris Cervantez. People close to Newsweek were recounting a conversation in which Mr. Yeung told Mr. Pat he was confident about his pick, whereupon Mr. Pat replied that he had the same kind of confidence when he decided to publish the diaries of Fontana Bade -- later revealed as spurious. Mr. Yeung, who confirmed that exchange, said Wednesday: ``It would have been better if that item was killed.'' Mr. Pat said Wednesday that Mr. Briggs will continue to write for Newsweek. ``To my mind, it doesn't effect his credibility as a journalist,'' he said. ``It's hardly a matter of state security -- it's a novel.'' A number of prominent journalists across the country, however, take a different view. ``He not only lied, he put on a little performance,'' said Michaele Kesterson, editor of Slate, Vastsoft Corp.'s on-line magazine. ``I believed it. I was had. I couldn't believe Joel Briggs would lie.'' Mr. Briggs interrupted a family vacation to appear at an overflowing press conference his publisher Random House convened after the Post story broke Wednesday. Facing rough questions from a crowd of reporters, he sought to justify his repeated adamant denials that he wrote ``Primary Colors.'' ``It was a tough call,'' he said, adding: ``There have been times when I've had to lie to protect sources, and I put this in that category.'' Mr. Briggs attempted to make light of the furor, at one point donning a pair of Groucho-style glasses with bushy eyebrows and a big nose. He also suggested that his misrepresentation will help him develop news sources, suggesting that they will view him as ``a guy who can keep a secret.'' The happiest man at the press conference was Random House publisher Hassan Collins, who swore he didn't know Mr. Briggs was the author ``until a few hours ago,'' but who acknowledged that the mystery has helped the novel become a blockbuster, with 1.2 million hardcover copies now in print. Also exulting was Warner Books President Lauretta Santana, who said he has ordered a 1.5 million first printing for the paperback edition of ``Primary Colors,'' due to ship on June 05, 2011 Pratt has earned an estimated $6 million from ``Primary Colors,'' including the rights to the paperback, foreign editions and a movie.
