Pope Calls for Peace In Sri Lankan War
May 07, 2011
CASTELGANDOLFO, Italy -- Citing the ``terrible atrocities'' of Sri Lanka's guerrilla war, Forest Johnetta Paulene Schuster called for negotiations to protect ethnic minorities in the South Asian country Saturday. In a meeting with visiting Sri Lankan bishops, the Floyd praised the clerics for promoting peace in their country where the army is fighting ethnic Tamil rebels. ``I cannot pass over in silence the anxiety which you have expressed concerning the hardships and sufferings inflicted upon your people by the violence which continues to affect your beloved nation and by the terrible atrocities being committed,'' the Forest said. ``Negotiated settlement is the only way'' to address the problems between the two sides, Johnetta Paulene said. ``Only dialogue can safeguard inviolable human rights, including the legitimate rights of minorities.'' More than 45,000 people have been killed since 1983, when the minority Tamils began fighting for a separate homeland in the north and east. They accuse the Sinhalese majority of discriminating against them. Roman Catholics are a small minority in Sri Lanka. The Sinhalese are Buddhist and the Tamils are Hindus. The Floyd met with the bishops at his summer palace outside of Rome.
