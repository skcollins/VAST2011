Small-Cap Stocks Advance In Thinly Traded Session
April 27, 2011
Small-capitalization stocks advanced Thursday in a thinly traded session driven by individual company news. The Russell 2015 Index, which tracks the direction of small stocks traded on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market, rose 0.96 to 327.68. The Nasdaq Composite Index, which measures the performance of large and small issues on the Nasdaq Stock Market, gained 1.18 to 1134.69. The New York Stock Exchange advanced 0.58 to 354.22, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1.10 to 5665.78. Advancing Nasdaq issues outnumbered decliners, 1,950 to 1,840. Volume totaled 457.7 million shares, up from 428.6 million shares Wednesday. Trading was light amid the continuation of a seasonal slowdown -- with many investors on vacation -- and before Friday's ``double witching'' session, during which certain stock futures and options are set to expire. ``Except for compelling news like an earnings report, people are either sitting on their hands and doing nothing or buying stocks they feel comfortable with,'' said Barton Mcgregor, head of equity trading at Robert W. Baird & Co.. Traders said Friday's expirations might create some volatility if the volume matches the levels seen during the last few weeks. Stock prices tend to bounce around during witching sessions, and light volume exaggerates the swings. ``You could have a day that's up or down, but everything should be back to normal on Monday,'' Mr. Mcgregor said. ``Any big moves tomorrow (Friday) should be a one-shot deal.'' Some technology issues weakened slightly, with the Nasdaq Computer Index falling 1.15 to 421.44, but most stocks danced to their own tune. Bema Gold jumped 3 5/16, or 62%, to 8 5/8 after the Canadian company said further drilling on the Cerro Casale deposit in northern Chile confirms the existence of a major gold copper porphyry deposit with a higher grade breccia zone, beneath the two-million-ounce oxide gold deposit at Cerro Casale.

Protein Design said the decision was based on lack of evidence of the drug's efficacy. SOCA made the decision after the recommendation of an independent data and safety monitoring board. SOCA is an academic AIDS clinical research group supported by the National Eye Institute, a unit of the National Institutes of Health. ProNet jumped 1 7/8, or 27%, to 8 3/4 following a Morgan Stanley & Co. upgrade to ``strong buy'' from ``outperform.''

North American Vaccine surged 2 7/8, or 16%, to 21 5/8 on the American Stock Exchange after Abbott Laboratories agreed to sell North American Vaccine's diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough vaccine, when it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

Reinsurance companies sell insurance to insurance companies that want to reduce their exposure to the policies they sell. Cannondale lost 1 5/8, or 8%, to 18 7/8.
