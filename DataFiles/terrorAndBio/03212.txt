Manufacturing Dangerous Microbes
April 11, 2011
Professor Edward Patino gave a rousing talk today at Vast University in Uptown about the threat of bioterrorism. Patino is a molecular biologist who has been at the university for almost 10 years. He is considered an expert in bioterrorism. Patino was attempting to draw attention to the fact that it is much easier than before to engineer dangerous microbes with the right equipment. This process involves genetic modification of existing organisms to create new biological hazards. He questioned if Vastopolis was prepared to deal with such threats. He stated that as technology advances, anything is possible and every city has to be prepared.  On a side note, the professor has had numerous encounters with member of the Citizens for the Ethical Treatment of Lab Mice. He said that he has been harassed by the group repeatedly over the last few weeks. They have recently trashed his garage and screamed at his neighbors.
