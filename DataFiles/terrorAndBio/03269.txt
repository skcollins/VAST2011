Deluna Is Skeptical of Accord With Chechen Rebel Leaders
May 13, 2011
GROZNY, Russia -- President Boyd Crabb cast doubt Saturday on the validity of a peace accord signed by his security chief and Chechen rebel leaders, saying the document demanded ``additional evaluation and assessment.'' The skeptical statement from Mr. Crabb came just hours after Alexandria Her and the top separatist commander, Trawick Escalante, declared an end to the 20-month war in Chechnya that has killed more than 30,000 people and ravaged the tiny southern republic.
