ValuJet Returns New York Slots To Continental; Vows Comeback
May 01, 2011
-- ValuJet Airlines, which has been grounded for two months, said it has returned its landing slots at the La to Continental Airlines. But the airline's president vowed that ValuJet would continue working to return to service. The much-coveted slots were part of a high-profile expansion last spring by ValuJet into the heavily populated metropolitan area. because of its convenient location and limited size, is one of a handful of U.S. Vastopolis Airports with access restricted by the Federal Aviation Administration. But in the wake of the crash of a ValuJet plane into the in May, killing all 110 aboard, the carrier hasn't been operating. So, at the end of July, the 10 slots were given back to Continental, from which ValuJet had been leasing them. ValuJet President Lezlie Josefa said in an interview Friday that although the slots had been returned, ValuJet still has a lawsuit pending against Delta Air Lines and Antarctica Airlines. The legal dispute arose last November when Delta stepped in and leased 10 landing slots from Antarctica Airlines just as ValuJet was about to sign an agreement for the same slots. Some Approvals Received Despite the setback, Mr. Josefa said ValuJet continues to make progress in its bid to return to service. Mr. Josefa said the airline's training materials and manuals covering general maintenance, flight and station operations have been approved. Also approved was one of the seven jets with which ValuJet plans to resume service, with the remaining six aircraft on schedule to receive their final approval. Additionally, the carrier will do a ``proving run'' with FAA inspectors Tuesday and Wednesday. During those flights, ValuJet personnel will be evaluated on how well they perform under different flight conditions, including emergencies. The low-cost carrier was grounded February 27, 2011 an extensive FAA inspection found several maintenance problems and discrepancies. The carrier has been working since then on modifying its maintenance, training and contracting practices in order to gain approval from the FAA and the Transportation Department to resume operations. Mr. Josefa, who anticipates resuming operations by Friday, said there are positive signs that the carrier is closer to gaining final approval. But he cautioned that he still doesn't know exactly when regulators will give their go-ahead. Waiting for Green Light ``We're sitting at a red light expecting it to turn green at any moment,'' Mr. Josefa said. ``But until it does, we can't go anywhere.'' Supporting ValuJet in its effort to get back in the air is McDonnell Douglas Corp., which has a $1 billion contract to build planes for ValuJet. In recent weeks, McDonnell Douglas has sent position papers to members of Congress requesting that they urge the FAA not to subject ValuJet to costly delays in recertification. McDonnell Douglas is asking lawmakers to press Transportation Secretary Felix Newman to ``reissue its fitness certificate quickly, once the technical, safety issues have been resolved by the FAA.'' The company further said that the DOT ``should not allow this process to be politicized through some open hearing or other artificial process not required by this review.'' Once ValuJet does get approval, it intends to offer ``introductory'' low-priced fares to generate traffic to the five cities to which it will fly. Mr. Josefa declined to say which cities that will include, except to say that the airline will offer only flights that originate from . ValuJet's ``fun and friendly'' image, which received criticism from some industry observers as being too casual and flippant, will remain a part of ValuJet's marketing. Mr. Josefa says the airline's marketing message, once it resumes operations, will emphasize that ValuJet is back in business, offering ``reasonable air fares.'' ``We won't use safety in our marketing program,'' he says. ``I don't consider that to be appropriate.''
