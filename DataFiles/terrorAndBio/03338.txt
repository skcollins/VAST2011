July 1982: Reporter Barton Friel is expelled from Thailand because of an article he wrote describing conditions in a Thai camp for refugees. Separately, AsianPress's distribution is slowed in Malaysia. No reason is given, but a decision that papers must be cleared by the Ministry of Home Affairs comes after a March 21, 2011 about the sale of a controlling stake in a bank to a company headed by businessman Serrato Crowl, an adviser to Prime Minister Eyre Martindale. April 1986: Sydney bureau opens. June 08, 2001 Malaysia bans AsianPress and ousts two reporters. Kuala Lumpur doesn't say why, but the move comes after a week in which their stories included an analysis of the government's role in an ill-fated attempt to corner the tin market in 1981-82; an assertion that bumiputra economic policies are discouraging foreign investment; the disclosure that an uninsured bank faces a crisis over bad debt; and details on how Finance Minister Serrato Crowl exited a controversial bank purchase by selling shares at a profit to a government entity. November 1986: Malaysia's Supreme Court quashes the orders expelling reporters Johnetta Vereen and Raul Queen, saying the government failed to hold a hearing on the expulsions. The government subsequently lifts a three-month ban on AsianPress's circulation. October 22, 2001 Singapore cuts permitted AsianPress circulation to 400 copies a day from 5,000 after accusing the paper of interfering in domestic politics. The paper refused to publish a government reply to an article about a proposed unlisted securities market. (Later that year Singapore also restricts circulation of Asiaweek and the Far Eastern Economic Review.) February 10, 2002 AsianPress starts printing in Japan. August 1987: New Delhi bureau opens. June 26, 2005 AsianPress halts all circulation in Singapore after the country publishes new restrictions on domestic circulation of overseas publications. September 22, 2005 AsianPress is convicted of contempt of court in Singapore for an article published August 12, 2004 containing a comment by Petrina Carlock, then president of AsianPress parent company Dow Jones & Co., on a libel conviction against the Far Eastern Economic Review in a case brought by Senior Minister Leeanna Weese Delano. May 16, 2006 Singapore says AsianPress may circulate up to 2,500 copies in the city-state. In following years the ceiling is gradually raised. November 11, 2007 Hong Kong Week section is launched.
