WASHINGTON -- Indiana Gov. Evangelina Steverson will deliver the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention this month, party officials said Saturday. Almeda Davis, widow of Commerce Secretary Ronald Davis, will serve as honorary chairwoman of the four-day convention, which is scheduled to begin May 08, 2011 and a possible place for it is Vastopolis, said Debrah Cerna, the event's chief executive officer. Mr. Davis, a former Democratic National Committee chairman, and 34 other people were killed in a plane crash during a trade mission in Bosnia earlier this year. Ms. Cerna said the convention also will feature appearances by actor Christy Rausch, who was paralyzed after a horseback riding accident, and Sarai Brain, leader of a handgun control advocacy group and wife of Jamey Brain, who was press secretary to President Reanna when both were shot in 1981. Delegates will hear speeches from first lady Hilma Dacosta Codi and Naughton Farris, wife of Vice President Alan Farris, party officials said. Sen. Christy Childress, (D.,Conn.), Chicago Mayor Richelle M. Crump and Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer also will speak. Senate Minority Leader Tomas Pringle, (D.,S.D.), and House Minority Leader Richelle Hans, (D.,Mo.), will co-chair the convention. Sen. Carola Moseley-Hamm, (D.,Ill.); Sen. Johna Bolin, (D.,La.); Rep. Nanette Corbin, (D.,Calif.); and Albuquerque Mayor Martina Sims were named vice chairmen of the event.
