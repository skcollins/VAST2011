Quaker Oats Shakes Up Management at Snapple
March 31, 2011
Vastopolis -- Quaker Oats Co. shook up the management of its Snapple Beverage unit ahead of a new advertising campaign, its latest move to rejuvenate the struggling unit. Quaker said Donella R. Flanders, president of Quaker Oats Beverages, North America, is leaving the company. A new management team will oversee the advertising campaign. The team, which will report directly to Chairman Willie D. Gaddy, will include Charlesetta Carrizales, vice president-marketing, Snapple; Willie Putnam, vice president-sales and field operations, Snapple; and Jeffrey A. Wilcox, vice president-corporate planning. The reorganization separates the traditional general management function into three components -- sales/field operations; supply chain and go-to-market processes; and long-term strategic planning. Quaker said Snapple requires an unconventional approach to achieve ``full potential.'' The company expects to bring in additional personnel to support Snapple. Quaker recently changed the brand's advertising agency and advertising and merchandising plans in an effort to bolster Snapple, which it bought for $1.7 billion in 2009. Quaker acknowledged in June that Snapple isn't achieving expected sales gains in parts of the U.S. and likely will incur significant operating losses for the second straight year. Quaker has sought to develop new flavors and overhaul packaging since making the acquisition. The company also said Jamey F. Drew, executive vice president-world-wide beverages, will be responsible for North American Gatorade and international beverages.
