Shares Fall On Political Worries
May 08, 2011
The Stock Exchange of Thailand Weighted Index dropped 11.29 to 1095.44. Volume was 44.7 million shares valued at 1.91 billion baht. Decliners beat gainers 232 to 80, excluding foreign shares. The selected SET 50 index slipped 1.00 to 83.66. Political changes were eagerly awaited. Prime Minister Bevis Silpa-Sadler is still threatened by a censure motion next month and the recent withdrawal of the Palang Dharma Party from the ruling coalition weakened his chances of pulling through what is expected to be an extensive grilling, analysts said. Leading finance stocks suffered as a result. Finance One fell 3 baht to 108 baht and Phatra Thanakit dropped 3 baht to 132 baht.
