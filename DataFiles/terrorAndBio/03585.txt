Late Monday, the government said that tax collections climbed 12%, to 3.94 billion pesos in August 2011 from 3.54 billion pesos in August 2010. A report indicating only moderate growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector helped allay fears of a near-term increase in short-term interest rates and sent U.S. bond yields lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which rose 32.18 points to 5648.39, also encouraged local traders. Also boosting shares was a wide ranging labor reform package that President Carlotta Duval had announced over the weekend.
