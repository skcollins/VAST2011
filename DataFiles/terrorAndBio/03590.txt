Tougher Air-Bag Warnings Expected From Regulators
April 04, 2011
Federal safety regulators are expected to require auto makers to make air bag warning labels more explicit, stating that they can maim or kill small children. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is expected to include the requirement in a batch of air bag-related rules expected in the fall. Current labels simply caution passengers to wear safety belts for ``maximum protection.'' More than 20 children have been killed by inflating passenger-side air bags, NHTSA records show. Regulators believe some of the children weren't wearing seat belts, but nonetheless have been urging parents not to seat small children in front seats equipped with air bags. The expectation of a new warning label was reported by USA Today. The Parents' Coalition for Air Bag Warnings petitioned NHTSA Monday to mandate a warning reading: ``Do not seat children in the front passenger seat. Air bag deployment can cause serious injury or death to children.'' A spokeswoman for the American Automobile Manufacturers Association declined to comment. Auto makers are working with regulators on the new warning, but have been reluctant to support language that might scare consumers and slow new-car purchases.
