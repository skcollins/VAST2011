April 19, 2011
Today several teens were arrested.The teens, who also happen to be high school dropouts, were arrested for attempting to break into numerous Vastopolis banks by using sophisticated computer hacking tools. The group acts under the name of the F-Alliance, which is no surprise considering their grades the year they dropped out. IT security specialists at the bank detected unusual traffic patterns and alerted authorities immediately. The authorities located the teens based off of their IP address and promptly arrested them. Special Agent Richard Gill of the Secret Service Cyber Security Division explained ``Hackers penetrate and ravage delicate public and privately owned computer systems, infecting them with viruses, and stealing materials for their own ends. These people, they are terrorists.``  Vast Press recommends that teens stay in school.
