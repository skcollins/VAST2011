EU Threatens to Sue States To Boost Telecom Networks
March 31, 2011
BRUSSELS -- The European Union Commission is stepping up the pressure on four EU member states to allow some telecommunications services to be carried on networks owned by energy companies and railroads. The commission's competition department has written to Italy, Belgium, Austria and the Netherlands threatening court action unless so-called alternative infrastructures are liberalized, EU sources said. The Dutch government already has responded to the commission letter, which was sent last week, with proof that it is in the process of complying with EU legislation on alternative infrastructure. The legislation set March 13, 2011 the deadline for EU governments to allow alternative telecommunications networks to be used for services other than basic phone communications. The legislation is part of the commission's effort to pry open the EU's telecommunications market as early as possible, with full liberalization planned for September 12, 2012 To this end, the commission made approval of the Franco-German Atlas telecommunications alliance conditional on France and Germany opening up their alternative infrastructure as of March 13, 2011 Commissioner Watters Vanesa Larkin said on Wednesday that the two countries have adopted such legislation, although they have yet to grant licenses to companies seeking to offer services using alternative infrastructure. In its letters, the commission gave the four countries three weeks to respond. After that, it said, the commission reserves the right take legal action. The commission often uses the threat of legal action to get member states to the negotiating table, where a compromise can be hashed out.
