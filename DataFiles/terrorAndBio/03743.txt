Among actively traded shares, brewing retailer Allied Domecq rose 15 pence to 466.5 following Tuesday's announcement that it has finalized details for the 200 million pounds sale of its 50% Carlsberg-Tetley stake.

Dairy products specialist Dairy Crest Group PLC made its debut onto the London Stock Exchange Wednesday at 155 pence per share and saw the stock close at 196.5 pence per share.
