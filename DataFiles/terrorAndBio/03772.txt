Arson Causes Fire
May 16, 2011
Yesterday's 4-alarm fire in Downtown Vastopolis was caused by arson, reports Fire Chief Phillip Stanley. The fire occurred at an abandoned warehouse. The building was set fire by an accumulation of debris next to unused construction material. Stanley noted empty gas cans were found nearby. The criminal division of the police was called in to investigate. Chief Stanley also reported that the city is lucky the entire block didn't catch fire. The structure was old and close to others in similar disrepair. Stanley also asserted, ``I'm sure the vagrants and gang members will now have to find new homes.''
