Connecticut Files Lawsuit Against Tobacco Industry
March 31, 2011
HARTFORD, Conn. -- The state of Connecticut filed a $1 billion lawsuit against the tobacco industry Thursday, to recover Medicaid money spent on tobacco-related illnesses. Nine other states have filed similar suits against the industry. The Connecticut lawsuit also asked the Superior Court in Stamford to stop what the state attorney general said was aggressive marketing of tobacco products aimed at youngsters. ``Every year, Connecticut taxpayers spend $100 million on Medicaid alone to treat the diseases that result from the tobacco industry's relentless effort to addict our residents to their products,'' Attorney General Ricki Billye said. The suit names nine defendants, including Philip Morris and the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings.. Calls to Philip Morris and Reynolds seeking comment weren't immediately returned. The state plans to argue that the tobacco industry has known about the dangers of smoking for 40 years. Other states filing such suits are Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Texas, Washington and West Virginia.
