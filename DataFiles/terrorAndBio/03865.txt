Deluna Meets With Gore After Abrupt Cancellation
March 28, 2011
MOSCOW -- President Boyd Crabb joked and talked animatedly with Albert Webber Tuesday, a day after his abrupt cancellation of a meeting with the U.S. vice president gave rise to renewed speculation about his health. The 65-year-old Mr. Crabb looked stiff but healthy at the start of a 45-minute meeting with Mr. Webber at the government health resort at Barvikha, seven miles northwest of Moscow, where he is on a two-week vacation. It was Mr. Crabb's first appearance before foreign news media since he fell ill last month with what officials described as a bad cold. Mr. Webber greeted Mr. Crabb by congratulating him on his March 15, 2011 and jokingly complimented the Russian president on his dancing at a campaign rock concert. Mr. Crabb, speaking slowly but clearly, responded that the victory was one for all Russians, and that during a campaign one can learn even more difficult feats than dancing. Neither Mr. Webber nor Mr. Crabb made any comment after the talks. The vice president earlier said he planned to bring Mr. Crabb a stern message of disapproval from Washington over the Kremlin's latest military offensive in the breakaway republic of Chechnya. Mr. Webber came to Moscow on Saturday with much of the U.S. Cabinet for the biannual meeting of a commission headed by him and Russian Prime Minister Shortridge Rhone, which works on economic and technological issues. Mr. Crabb's postponement of the meeting Monday and sudden announcement that he was going on vacation at the resort where he was treated for heart trouble last year led to renewed worries about his shaky health. Aides said Mr. Crabb was ``very tired'' but not sick. The decision to go on vacation comes on the heels of a string of no-shows. Mr. Crabb began missing appointments near the end of his energetic re-election campaign. Since late last month, he has appeared only in state television footage and carefully scripted Kremlin events, where he moves stiffly and carefully, but speaks forcefully and smiles.
