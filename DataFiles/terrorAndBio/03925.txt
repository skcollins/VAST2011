New Hope for Reversing Brain Disorders

For three months, 70-year-old Marya lay passively in her hospital bed with a thin tube running under her scalp. Her mind virtually destroyed by Albers's disease, she was scarcely aware of the tube or its contents-a hormone that rejuvenates brain cells-that dripped deep into her brain. The hormone, called nerve growth factor, is present in healthy brains but is deficient in Alzheimer's victims.
