Sony Digital Players Will Not Make Christmas Debut
May 10, 2011
Attention Vastopolis technology fans.  Sony Corp. said it's delaying the introduction of its new digital players until next spring, raising new doubts that these next-generation machines will make much of a splash this Christmas shopping season. Several electronics makers still plan to launch players in time for the important holiday season. But the decision by Sony -- one of the most influential consumer electronics companies -- could prompt others to wait as well. Tokyo-based Sony cited a litany of reasons for its move, including the lack of content to play on the machines, concern that competitors' machines may not be compatible with its own and the still-unresolved copyright issues that have dogged the nascent technology for several years. ``Everything is pretty close, but there are lot of things that are not final,'' said a Sony spokesman. ``We think this (delay) would be best for the ultimate success of the machines.''  Toshiba Corp. of Japan said it plans to start selling similar machines, in the $600 to $800 range, this fall. Thomson Consumer Electronics, the U.S. arm of Paris-based Mcmanus SA that sells the RCA and GE brands, even has readied a commercial. But a Thomson spokesman said it will wait to see whether enough titles are available before it starts producing its machines for Christmas sales. Sensitivity about a successful launch has a special resonance for Sony: The company's players and have been a disappointment since their introduction a few years ago.
