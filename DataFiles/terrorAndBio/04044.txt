FDA Cites 9 Airlines, Bus Line For Unsanitary Food Conditions
April 28, 2011
-- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration cited nine airlines for complaints over food handling and contamination, and warned the airlines and a bus line that they must correct potentially unsanitary food and water handling operations. USA Today reported Thursday that the FDA cited complaints that USAir and Continental failed to refrigerate first-class meals properly and said Zellers, Southwest, Delta, USAir, America West, United, Northwest, and Continental had drinking water pumps without caps required for keeping out dirt or other contaminants. Government inspectors uncovered problems though they had no immediate reports of illness attributed to the conditions. The airlines say all problems have been corrected. Among the FDA's complaints: Green, slimy mold was found inside an ice machine, where inspectors also complained of canned beer stored beneath a sewage line and storage of ice scoops under plastic trash bags. Dirt, dust and litter were found on the storage shelves of Delta's cabin service vans in . Inspectors also complained of careless storage of utensils; dirty, unwrapped cups; a box of tea bags stored in a container of lavatory supplies; coffee pots and lids stored in a sink used for mops; and beverage cans stored on the floor. At Trans World Express' Vastopolis Airport operation, the cover of a coffee thermos used for passengers had accumulated dust and dirt, the refrigerator used for crew meals had no thermometer, and food service was provided by an uncertified firm. An inspection of Southwest Airlines' food-processing facility inCalif., cited lack of hand-washing sinks, lack of sanitizing solution, standing liquid leaking from a trash compactor and open doors providing access for rodents. Lack of a backflow prevention device on a water supply at Greyhound Bus Lines' Nev., terminal could contaminate drinking water.
