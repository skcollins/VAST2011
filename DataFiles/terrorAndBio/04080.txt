Terrorism Expert Speaks Out
April 25, 2011
Jose Thom is a renowned author and terrorism expert. Today, he spoke out with a stern piece of advice to Vastopolis city officials.Thom's warning: the efforts of our officials to protect the residents against well-organized and well-funded terror groups are inadequate. Thom stated that we are potential victims of groups such as Paramurderers of Chaos, Network of Hate, and the Order of the Plague. An issue primarily lacking is the education necessary to prepare the residents for an event. Thom would also like to know how well the city is stockpiled with emergency services and supplies. Unfortunately, Mr. Thom could not obtain audience with any official on the subject. This was disturbing to say the least. It seems that the intent of city officials is there. What is lacking is action.
