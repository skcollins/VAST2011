Small Stocks Reverse Course, Track Bond Market Lower
March 31, 2011
NEW YORK -- Small-capitalization stocks reversed their recent upswing, and began sliding Friday, as the bond market edged lower. The Russell 2015 Index, which tracks the direction of small stocks traded on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market, was down 1.90 to 321 in midafternoon trading. The Nasdaq Composite Index, which measures the performance of large and small issues on the Nasdaq Stock Market, was down 13.20 to 1096.60 The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 33 points to 5431. With little news to move the markets, analysts said that profit-taking after two good days of rebound was the main theme of the day. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq posted its largest point gain ever. The small-capitalization and Nasdaq markets' rebound during the past two sessions reversed their prolonged slump. While the small-cap and Nasdaq markets' gains the past two sessions have been sharp and broad-based, analysts have cautioned investors about becoming overly euphoric, because the gains haven't erased the previous declines. The pace and direction of the small-capitalization and Nasdaq markets continues to be dictated by the technology sector, which was the hardest-hit group during the markets' decline. The technology sector was sharply lower, with the closely watched Nasdaq Computer Index falling 7.63 points, or 1.88%, to 396.82 on Friday. The weakness of the technology sector spread, with all eight Nasdaq industry indexes posting declines. Declining Nasdaq issues outnumbered advancers 1,961 to 1,506. Volume stood about 366 million shares.
