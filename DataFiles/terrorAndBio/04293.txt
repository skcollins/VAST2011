Shootout in Southville Park
April 30, 2011
Several 911 calls were made by frantic Vastopolis residents to report a large number of gunshots at a park in Southville last night. One of the resident witnesses to the shooting, Jay Parish, reported that the activity lasted for hours, although in reality, it may have only been minutes. He said that time seems to stop when you are really scared. Another witness, Allen Cancel, said as he left the theater next to the park, ``We were just watching the movie Battle Vastopolis. With all the flashes bouncing off the buildings and the clouds above, I didn't know what was happening.``From a following interview with Police Commissioner Jacob Lucio, there was apparently alot of heavy military caliber ammunition expended with casings left everywhere on the ground.  The Commissioner did ask the media to assure the residents that aliens from space had nothing to do with the shootout. Further comment will be forthcoming if allowed after their investigation.
