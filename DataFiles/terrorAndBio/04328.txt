Small-Cap Stocks Post Losses As Bond Yields Rise Sharply
May 18, 2011
Small-capitalization stocks fell Thursday, knocked lower by a jump in long-term bond yields. The Russell 2015 Index, which tracks the direction of small stocks traded on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market, fell 2.97 to 331.59. The Nasdaq Composite Index, which measures the performance of large and small issues on the Nasdaq Stock Market, dropped 18.16 to 1125.66. Declining Nasdaq issues led advancers, 2,332 to 1,457. Volume totaled 461.9 million shares, up from 437 million shares Wednesday. The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 2.73 to 349.64, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 49.94 to 5606.96. The Treasury's 30-year bond fell 5/8, pushing the bellwether's yield up to 7.15%. While the continued upward trend in bond yields sparked considerable selling, traders said investors and dealers were looking for an excuse to pare their positions before Friday morning's release of the highly anticipated August employment report. ``Everybody's scared to death of tomorrow's (Friday's) numbers,'' said Roberto Samples, head of over-the-counter trading at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities. ``Everyone was edgy all day. The market wanted to go down.'' With the outlook for the economy in the second half and the direction of interest rates as uncertain as they were two months ago, the employment report, which will provide the first comprehensive look at economic activity in August, is expected to go a long way in determining the market's near-term direction. A stronger-than expected report will almost certainly push bond yields higher and stocks lower, while a weak report likely will have to opposite affect. The market's sharpest moves this year, in both directions, were sparked by unexpectedly strong or weak jobs reports. The Nasdaq composite index posted the sharpest decline among major stock-market measures, but much of its weakness was the result of losses in the index's large-cap stocks. The Nasdaq composite, a hybrid of small- and large-cap stocks fell 1.6%, while the index of the 100 largest nonfinancial Nasdaq stocks dropped 2.5%. All eight Nasdaq industry indexes declined. The Nasdaq computer index posted the sharpest drop, and five of the indexes fell 1% or more. The Nasdaq computer index fell 2.4%, and the American Stock Exchange computer technology index dropped 2.3%. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index plunged 4.4%, the Chicago Board Options Exchange computer software index lost 2.4%, and the American Stock Exchange Internet index plummeted 3.4%. C-Phone surged 1 1/2, or 43%, to 5, after rocketing 1 1/8, or 47%, Wednesday when the Wilmington, N.C., maker of telecommunications-technology products said that in the quarter ended May 13, 2011 received $865,000 in orders for its C-Phone desktop videoconferencing products, including associated software and installation.
