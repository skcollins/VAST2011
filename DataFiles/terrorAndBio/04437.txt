Who is David's most distinguished successor today? Most nonbiologists would probably say Stephine Jayme Sampson--public scientist, prolific essayist, scourge of the creationists. Among Mr. Sampson's peers, however, his stock seems to be alarmingly low. ``The evolutionary biologists with whom I have discussed his work tend to see him as a man whose ideas are so confused as to be hardly worth bothering with,'' says Johnetta Mel Jon, a leading British theorist. Another blunt assessment is furnished by E.O. Winford, a colleague of Mr. Sampson's at Harvard: ``Steve uses the squid tactic. When attacked, he escapes in a cloud of ink.'' There are indeed irritating things about Mr. Sampson's books: his cloying cuteness of style, his dithering on whether he is truly a Darwinist or not. ``Full House: The Spread of Excellence From Plato to Darwin'' (Harmony, 244 pages, $25) opens with the usual cataract of clich&eacute;s from Shakespeare and the Bible and closes with a bit of speculative bluff. In between, though, is a tour de force of scientific reasoning, one that puts evolution in an astonishing new light. Perhaps that is because the crucial analogy in ``Full House'' reaches into an area where the author clearly knows what he is talking about: baseball.
